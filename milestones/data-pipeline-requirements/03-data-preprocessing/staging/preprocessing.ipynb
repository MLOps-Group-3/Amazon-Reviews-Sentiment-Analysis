I had it on the finest grind, and it got stuck day one, so I set it back one and no problems since. Plus, it measures for me. 4.5 is perfect for my needs, and the hopper holds more than a week's worth of beans.<br /><br />I'm so thankful not to have to push down the inconvenient plunger on a Capresso blade grinder--which, by the way, necessitated I do 2 batches: dump the uncompressed ground coffee into the lid, to dig out the fine grind stuck in the bottom, then finish grinding the rest...a painful mess, every single day). I even had a special spatula I used to keep from dulling the blades with metal.\n",
      "I was so excited about this! I had high expectations but I shouldn't have. The frame is quite flimsy and one of the pieces came bent, I had to bend it to make it connect correctly. Assembly was simple, even though it was not in English the pictures were detailed. After it was put together (took me about 30 minutes) it served it's purpose. I wouldn't pay $56 for it if I saw it in store.\n",
      "We bought this because it pictures totes under it and we need storage in the room it's in. The standard totes we have will not fit under it. We will have to purchase smaller storage to be able to store under it.<br />It assembles easily and doesn't make any noise.\n",

I'm not fond of this coat rack but it is usable for now and I didn't want to spend more than $20. The rack is wobbly and I tried as much as I could to redo the screws with no luck. So, I'll have to put a 1/2cm of felt underneath one of the legs to level it. For my coat rack I received, there were 2 screws that would not, for the life of me, go into the holes. The top decorative piece did not go in and a screw for one of the lower hook didn't either. I tried lightly tapping with the hammer but those 2 screws won't budge. :-( I had no missing pieces, it just dint go together as I would like and is lopsided.

      "The rod seems sturdy enough. Mounting isn't complicated. Finial is very pretty.<br /><br />I am the one who puts all our things together and mounts them. But there are no holes in the end of the poles to screw the finials into. Easy as pie, said another reviewer. Just push through the plastic. I have been trying to make the first hole now for 15 minutes. I used a stilleto. Hole, but won't admit the screw. Used screwdriver. Won't admit the screw. I'm about to try a knitting needle. Ok, knitting needle worked. I hope you have one. But really, it should not be this difficult to do. The hole in the plastic should at a minimum be started for you. No, darn it. The hole in the middle should be clean.<br /><br />Screwing the finial in now takes a lot of pressure because it doesn't want to properly seat. Are we having fun? Great, pressure used to screw in the finial slightly warped the end. But at least now the inner pole doesn't slide out like butter on a hot griddle.<br /><br />I opened my size 36-72\" . They make 72\" with a 3\" overlap in the middle.<br /><br />For this price I don't expect marble. I do expect to not have to go through this for a stupid piece of plastic!

      "I purchased a Mr. Coffee Steam Espresso System with Milk Frother for a friend about a year ago and was really impressed with the quality and functionality. So I decided to finally replace my old Krups espresso maker. Regretfully, this one is not of the same quality as the Mr. Coffee unit I previously purchased for a friend. Although functional, every visible component is of cheaper quality in comparison to the unit I purchase before; i.e thinner and lighter materials and a smaller unit overall. Being a pressurized unit while in use, I hope these materials will hold up and not explode on me! Had I realized this was not the same unit, I would have made a point to discover the model number of the other one. Who would have known that Mr. Coffee would deceptively make two almost identical units and make one using lower quality materials. I will be scratching Mr. Coffee off my trusted brands list!\n",

      "UPDATE<br /><br />I‚Äôve found that in order to get a drink that is hot rather than warm, I have to run an empty filter espresso shot through before making my drink.<br /><br />Short version: You might find the porta-filter to be too small, or the milk/coffee ratios not to your liking. But perhaps you can fix that manually. I wound up buying an additional portages-filter, and using both. First, I run a one shot cappuccino through, then I run a double shot espresso. You could probably do this by swapping out the filter baskets, but it's a lot easier just to have two portas lined up.<br /><br />Details: I bought a refurbed Barista and have been messing around with it for a couple of days. I bought it to make lattes rather than straight espresso (I am not an espresso fan). I just like strong coffee with hot milk, as I learned on a recent trip to Italy where I was served that every morning at breakfast.<br /><br />I previously bought a cheap espresso machine, & have been making myself a latte each morning by adding microwaved milk. But I have learned that I like foamed milk, not just heated milk, & I have also learned that using a foaming wand to make it is messy. I have also learned that cheap espresso machines deliver unpredictable results, even if you pay close attention to all the measurements involved for amount of water & coffee.<br /><br />I bought this Barista machine because it promised foaming without the mess, predictable quantities of coffee & milk without needing to measure, automated cleanup of the wand, & a container for the milk that does not have to be poured each morning. Also because I got it for 60% off by buying a refurb.<br /><br />This machine's programmed features do not provide me with my desired ratio of milk to coffee, in the total amount I want to have in the morning. Although a double latte provides me with a large enough drink, it's short on coffee flavor & in order to bring it up to where I want it to be, I have to reload the porta-filter & make another shot of espresso to add, while my drink is cooling off.<br /><br />The point here is that the filter is too small - it only has room for one scoop of coffee, which probably works well enough for those little bitty cups of espresso people like, but does not allow for making decent sized lattes which are anything more than coffee flavored milk, at least if I am relying on the programmed latte button. So you can't juice up your latte by simply adding more espresso to the filter.<br /><br />There is, however, a manual workaround that delivers the goods. If I just separately make the foamed milk first, to the desired amount of milk & degree of foam, and then run a programmed double shot of espresso, I can create exactly the ratio of milk to coffee that I want, and have an acceptably sized drink.<br /><br />This is possible because the machine permits the user to produce only foamed milk, and to control the degree of foaming. The feature is described as being for adding additional milk to a drink, but it works just fine to start off with first adding the milk to the cup, then running the espresso. You have to watch the process in order to turn off the milk when you have the amount you want, but I've learned to listen to the pump pulses, and turn off the process when it's had a specific number of pulses.<br /><br />To start the manual milk delivery, you press & hold the Cappuccino button about 3 seconds. To end the delivery, you press the button again.<br /><br />For my taste, I use a decaf French dark roast coffee pre-ground for espresso. Part of my issue with the programmed latte may be that I'm using decaf. It might be delivering a less strong espresso than regular does. Or it might be that I don't grind my own beans. In other words, YMMV.\n",

Especially given the stitching on the hems were frayed, I do not feel they will hold up after too many laundry days.\n",
      "No matter what I do, the top is always lighter than the bottom.\n",
      "Really small ice cubes\n",
      "So much I love about this sheet set . Soft , cool, smooth . Great colors. However after only three months of use in my Airbnb rental the stain resistance has been put to the test and FAILED .spot treatments didn‚Äôt work If this was in my home I would just shrug my shoulders and move on, however for my vacation rental they just won‚Äôt do and I‚Äôm disappointed\n",
      "Love the color and it fits perfect. I deducted a star because it is not 3 inches thick . it is only 2. Also one star because it needs to have ties on the bottom on the leg area. It sides every time I sit down.\n",
      "It's okay. Not great, not terrible.\n",
      "I wish the rug was a little more light gray. It fit perfectly and the wife loves the feel.\n",
      "They serve their purpose, but are kind of thin. Colors are nice, but he bowls aren‚Äôt very sturdy.\n",
      "So this product is kinda eh the piece that covers the blade it‚Äôs like a little round metal ring where the cheese falls out after it‚Äôs graded so it‚Äôs like super sharp right there I have to watch out but I mean it graded it easy than hand doing it so it‚Äôs kinda good kinda bad\n",
      "Smaller than you think it is!! Not worth the price for the size...at target, you can get the same price for a much bigger microwave. Barely fits a dinner plate inside!\n",
      "Very thin\n",
      "Mattress arrived at 4:34pm, had it unrolled at 5:31pm. Originally had it upside down and at 11:30 PM flipped it right side up. Thats when I noticed a black mark in the middle of the top side. I removed the zip cover and the black mark was on the mattress itself however not as prominent. Another notable factor was indeed the smell. Immediately after removing the plastic package I smelled an unfamiliar stench. Definitely not green tea but it didn't smell like mold either, just obnoxious and foreign to me. Now, 6 hours later it's not as noticeable but I may have just gotten used to it. Not sure what I'm going to do about any of this but definitely worth a mention.<br /><br />24 he UPDATE: the smell is completely gone and the black mark washed out (mostly) from the zip cover. I do not think it was mold. More likely it was snagged on a piece of machinery.\n",
      "They were much thinner than expected. Hard to tell from photo.\n",
      "One of the zippers were broken but I love the prints so much. I might just add to the fabric and add buttons\n",
      "Sturdy nice coffee table. I would give it a 3 1/2 out of 5 if possible. Half a star docked for it coming with a 3&#34; scratch on the top and 1 star docked for one of the screw holes being to big for the screw. The screw didn't strip, the hole is just to big for it so not sure how that works. Still seems sturdy so I'm not going to bother boxing it back up and sending it back. Overall a nice cheap table. You won't find a better one in a store for the price of this.\n",
      "It did the job....<br />was pretty loud though.\n",
      "Chopped pourly\n",
      "This is my third one as the others leak after some time. I like the one-handed ease of use. Just press and hold the button to drink. Even though this one allows for access inside the cover, it's not easy to clean. The sipping hole gets yucky and is not the easiest to clean. Also, and a problem I had with the others is that it's typical to find little black floaties at the bottom when I open the lid. Even with this new one that hadn't had a chance to get moldy yet. My husband thinks it's flakes from the lid so we're probably ingesting plastic. Not so good. (Mine is a stainless one so it's not from paint. I only drink water from it so it's not from coffee/tea stains.) Next container will be another Kleen Kanteen.\n",
      "Home use when entertaining. More or less like what they‚Äôd use at the local pub. They pictured an assortment but of course I received some doubles and the one I wanted most with my wife‚Äôs maiden name on it was not included. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è May order again.\n",
      "Stiff and hard to position in a way that really seals a crack and stops air from blowing. But I didn't see anything on the market that looked better. Rolled-up t-shirts work a little better, if we'r ebeing honest.\n",
      "It‚Äôs a beautiful piece of furniture, unfortunately one section inside the wood appears to be worn because the screw will not go in smoothly to tighten. So it‚Äôs not very stable to sit on. Extra screws would have been nice.\n",
      "I did not realize copper was only coated on. It looked like it was a separate copper covering\n",
      "So far, after two months of daily use, nothing is sticking. that's quite a feat considering most non-stick pans I toss in about one week. It does give off an odor, which I hope is not a toxic vapor, but it sets off my smoke detector quite often. don't know how safe it is for your health, but as far as non-stick goes, it is as advertised\n",
      "The seller is great first of all. The shipping time was fast and the order was so neatly packed. I only had an issue with this brand of incense. Knowing the Blunt Effects brand from the fragrance spray, I expected these to be knockout heavy scented and emit the smell when burning. No. These are just as fragrant as the junk that you can get at Wmart. Very disappointed. It almost seems that these are cheap imitations. I apologize to the seller as this is NOT their fault and should not reflect on them... hence the mediocre review instead of NO STARS! :( Live and learn!\n",
      "Smaller than I thought but its okay.\n",
      "This package came all beat up and the bar is bent.\n",
      "Not real study\n",

      "Reviews of this rug said it was soft, etc but I find it very thin and hard. I guess I'm used to wool rugs but I had high expectations for this since reviews seemed good, but it's just an average rug in my opinion. The quality of an average Walmart rug. It's curly but I'm hoping it'll lay flat, have a box on the corner (see photo). Am concerned about the kids tripping on corner by the door but I might get some rug tape. Hoping it'll last a few years. It's in a guest room so won't be high trafficked. Really dislike the nylon edges, they always unravel, hoping this one won't. Will leave an update in a few months!<br /><br />Update: Been about a year and rug eventually lay flat but has become matted and even more hard. Surpringsly the nylon edges have held up and have not unraveled. Looks dirty though, even with regular vacuuming. If it wasn't such a pain to haul bed out and shove another rug underneath I would do it. Hopefully I can replace it eventually but I'm living with it for now.\n",
      "I bought queen size and they are super soft. A little oversized but already starting to fray a little after several washings.\n",
      "Easy enough to assemble. Boards were flimsier than anticipated. Won't last as lon as I'd like. Stickers to cover screw heads fell off.\n",
      "Attractive, but towels are on the thin side. You get what you pay for!!\n",
      "Little bit disappointed in this picture.\n",
      "Over all, I guess these gloves are as described, but not exactly what I was hoping for. They are quite big and bulky and, for me, don't provide any more agility than a typical oven mit.\n",
      "I wouldn‚Äôt call these ‚Äúblackout curtains‚Äù the light still comes through. The room is definitely darker but it‚Äôs definitely not blackout. A more appropriate name would be room darkening.\n",
      "Perfect for our party\n",
      "Works well, but does not stay on if container is too big. Can be difficult to get on.\n",
      "At first, I was really impressed with all the options you had with this egg maker. It looked really neat and promised to cook eggs quickly. It is a bit small, if you have a or large family, this wouldnt work. But for a single person. Or family of two, thus would have been perfect. My husband loves eggs and so do I. I like hard boiled eggs so i followed the directions but the eggs were still very soft. I was unpleasantly surprised by how off the timing was in the manual. My husband likes poached eggs but they turned out really bad usung this eggmaker. Luckily it was returnable :)\n",
      "Product seemed OK... No rust. There was no paperwork sent with product. No directions. The box contained a message to go to their blog site..... It's not in English and can't be translated. This is not helpful. Will give them a try this weekend.\n",
      "It‚Äôs too light\n",

      "I had similar results to others, trying to simply use it out of the box failed with anything like an egg. Heat, add butter or oil, add egg, insta-stick and a huge mess. :( Other things like ground meat, etc did the same, even after repeated use. So after a year or so decided to smooth it out. Started with 100 grit sandpaper, then 600 wet, then 2000 wet, then finally finish with toothpaste. Then did a light seasoning in the oven. Well, it is finally working as I like, fried eggs will now slide around smoothly if I give them a little initial push, impossible before. So I guess you get what you pay for, this is less $ than a smooth \"grey\" metal pan, so there. I don't understand how they make these, as the steel under the coating has an almost \"spray texture\" that you have to sand through to get smooth. You can see after polishing how it has a mottled appearance from this texture. The factory coating is horrible, akin to sprayed on black paint which flakes easily.\n",

      "Bought these a few years ago and needed to replenish our set. Was a little nervous about ordering glasses online. These were packaged very well in thick cardboard with dividers between each glass and underneath in between each size so no broken glasses!

We loved having the 3 different sizes of glasses so trying to find another set at stores was hard until I found this on here.\n",

      "I am a big fan of cast iron and really enjoy this pan. I've had it for a few years now. This pan is actually just the right thickness the iron is not too thick therefore not too heavy. The handles are stylish and practical.<br /><br />When I first got it I forgot how to bake in cast iron. So I often would put a dough into a cold pan and my bread would stick and cleaning was no fun. The trick with any cast iron, especially new one that still has nooks and crannies, is to warm up the pan first. I do this as I am warming up the oven. When the dough is placed into the cold pan it has time to go into all the crannies and create a deeper bond with a pan, so to speak. :-) However, when the dough is placed into a warmed up pan it sizzles and immediately forms a crust. Popping out bread and cleaning afterwards is a breeze.\n",

      "I was very nervous about ordering this rug. Prior to ordering it, I had ordered another &#34;ivory&#34; rug from a very popular rug maker that name starts with a &#34;S&#34;. That rug was ok, but not what I wanted. It was suppose to be an ivory (mix of ivory and silver) distressed rug, but looked more black and white. It did look nice, but not what i knew in my head i wanted. I couldnt believe how hard it is to find a true ivory rug with beige hues. It was also too big. Overstock was great and let me return it for free. I wanted a true distressed neutral rug with hues of beige and creams. Then I found this rug! (I bought the 6x9, not sure why it says I have a 5x8. I do not) From the pictures, it was exactly what I wanted, but I was nervous because pictures can be deceiving. But the rug arrived and looked exactly like the picture. The quality seems great. It is a thin rug, but thats what I wanted and its not paper thin. The pattern is very subtle, but there. The fibers were already laying a certain direction, and the rug looked even lighter and closer to the picture. But I took a broom and swept it the other direction and the colors and pattern came out just a little more, still leaving the distressed look. I love the fridge edges. They add a little more class to an already classy rug. One end of the rug was curled when I first unrolled it. I evened the rug out and placed my chair legs on the very edges of the rug to hold it down. The next morning, the rug was laying flat on its on. I did not get a rug pad, and tested this rug for slipping. It does not move. I do have it under my dining table and chairs, so not sure how it would perform in another area with no furniture on it. Thats all I can think to tell you about this rug. It is BEAUTIFUL and at this price, you cant beat it. I just moved, so Im decorating a new house. Im thinking about doing youtube tutorials for each room. I havent decided, but ive added a picture here so you could see the rug in my dining area. The room is not finished. I will be adding accessories to the dining table and buffet table, and maybe a plant in the corner, but just wanted to share an image with you guys to give you an idea. I cant believe in this day and age, more people arent adding images.\n",

      "The fabric has a weird feel to it. I can‚Äôt explain it. It looks great though\n",
      "The product is great but the table is slightly damaged in shipping..\n",
      "I was disappointed that the picture showed 3 towels and we only got one. They were a gift.\n",
      "Love these coasters. The marble design matches perfectly with my living room and love the softer material of them. One thing I will say is Bc of the material sometimes the bottom of my glass will stick to it. Good value for the price.\n",
      "Sturdy spatulas. Clean good. Don't put in the dishwasher.\n",
      "Easy to operate\n",
      "Bought these a few years ago and needed to replenish our set. Was a little nervous about ordering glasses online. These were packaged very well in thick cardboard with dividers between each glass and underneath in between each size so no broken glasses! These are an exact match to the remaining few I had left from previous purchase. Very impressed! We loved having the 3 different sizes of glasses so trying to find another set at stores was hard until I found this on here.\n",
      "Love it used everyday since it arrived, will update as needed if anything goes wrong but very pleased so far, did a tri tip, skirt steak, chicken breasts and have reheated leftovers with all great results. Checked temp with instant read and it was spot on.\n",
      "Love it! I really like that it made my mattress feel more firm due to all the supports. :) Also very easy to put together!\n",
      "Protects while allowing the beauty of the table to show through.\n",
      "This was easy to assemble myself and extremely sturdy. Delivered on all its promises. Great buy.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "I just steam ironed this bad booy and he's handsome and ready for halloween\n",
      "Made well but is not soft at all. Colors are a little more muted than the photo. Price is too high for the product.\n",
      "Item seem to be of good quality, however my one was slightly bent\n",
      "Decent towels. Not the best towels I have owned, but they are up there.<br /><br />Note that best absorbency is best after about 2 washes. Our of the box they are terrible, but get better after a few washes.\n",
      "Beautiful but pricey\n",
      "I recieved so many compliments on this item. Out it together myself in about 3hrs, not complicated just time consuming.\n",
      "I ordered 2 of these for my kids bedroom. Fairly simple to assemble. First one went together without issue. The second desks right drawer had the rails that came riveted on the metal unlevel. Because of this the right drawer was crooked and wouldn‚Äôt shut all the way. Instead of going through the hassle of shipping it back and dealing with that, I measure a 1/2 inch down on one side of the drawer and drilled new pilot holes and remounted the drawer rail. Closes fine now.\n",
      "Nice sheets and they arrived the morning after I had ordered them the night before. My only suggestion is that with the split king and other kings sets they include 4 pillow cases rather than two.\n",
      "I like buying cheap nonstick cookware that I can throw out when it starts sticking.\n",
      "Order for the Thanksgiving Holiday. Great price and package comes with every piece that you would need to cook a meal.\n",
      "Perfect size jars with screw on lids. Lots of labels included too! I'm going to buy more!\n",
      "Great as usual\n",
      "I am a big fan of cast iron and really enjoy this pan. I've had it for a few years now. This pan is actually just the right thickness the iron is not too thick therefore not too heavy. The handles are stylish and practical.<br /><br />When I first got it I forgot how to bake in cast iron. So I often would put a dough into a cold pan and my bread would stick and cleaning was no fun. The trick with any cast iron, especially new one that still has nooks and crannies, is to warm up the pan first. I do this as I am warming up the oven. When the dough is placed into the cold pan it has time to go into all the crannies and create a deeper bond with a pan, so to speak. :-) However, when the dough is placed into a warmed up pan it sizzles and immediately forms a crust. Popping out bread and cleaning afterwards is a breeze.\n",
      "I always had allergies but then I moved to socal and all of a sudden wildfires are blasting smoke all over town so I buckled down and got this thing. So far it seems like it works. On the lowest air setting its nice and quiet. My favorite part is that you get a free air filter replacement if you leave a review on amazon.\n",
      "Very happy about this purchase, nice product.\n",
      "It was fairly easy to assemble and does it‚Äôs job .<br />It‚Äôs not the most attractive, but it‚Äôs inside my closet so it works well\n",
      "Works great but beware it‚Äôs not battery powered! Still love it\n",
      "I've used this Meat Thermometer for two years, and am quite pleased overall. It's durable, has amazing battery life (I store it with the battery NOT installed), and a clear display. Lately, I've been getting some odd readings, though, so contacted ThermoPro. Despite the fact that I purchased this device two years ago -- and it's LONG out of warranty -- they quickly offered to send a replacement probe free of charge.<br /><br />Amazing customer service!\n",
      "The heating is great, control is good too. The only thing I could say I did have an issue with is I could feel the heating wires, and while unlike a heating pad these do not get hot only warm, it was the actual (think the pea under the bed) feeling of wires under my fitted sheet that bothered me. Otherwise I still use it and let me tell you, nothing beats crawling into a nice toasty bed during the chilly winter months! And for the price you will not find anything better.\n",
      "Really love this clothing hanger but as many have pointed out, the clothing rack is relatively easy to assemble but because of poor instructions I had to redo a few sections which doubled the amount of time it should've taken.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Bought this for my kids school, seemed pretty sturdy so it should do the trick.\n",
      "Well made just as good as the expensive ones\n",
      "I really like this clip on strainer. Before having this clip-on strainer I tried holding the pot lid at just the right angle to drain off water and would inevitably lose a lot of the food from the pot into the sink. That doesn‚Äôt happen anymore. So easy to use and clean. Just a great asset to my cooking enjoyment.\n",
      "I just put up some rib eyes ,I buy when on sale,The bags just make it so easy to get ready for freezer,and very easy to tell what is in package\n",
      "[[VIDEOID:451eede7410ab5ab7a2410bc9db74771]] They are beautiful, easy to ensemble. You can control both of them with the same control.. I might buy extra flowers to add some color..\n",
      "Party\n",
      "Works great. I take to the gym for hangin towels in the shower\n",
      "Love these! Wish they were a little smaller to fit my handle but overall good quality!\n",
      "The color is very bright.\n",
      "[[VIDEOID:a7c41c63f04a3d2c29e0935017cd9a93]] Magari mid century Modafyed Sofa. I like the balance of functionality and aesthetic. The fabric seems like it will hold up quite well. It's not over built but it's certainly not under built either. The back support doesn't go as high is the couch it's replacing. But I don't think that'll matter. Not having a fifth leg was important in my buying decisions as I needed something I could replace legs with casters. Mid century modern design is perfect for substituting six-inch casters for the legs using the bolts provided. As the video shows.\n",
      "This thing is pretty awesome. I hate mopping so this makes it less painful to keep my tile and hardwood floors clean. The only reason I deducted a star is because it won't scrub you floors like you could manually and cleaning the product is a bit of a pain. You should clean it after every use, unlike a vacuum. Plus you can't just dump it out in the sink cause there'll be hair, fuzz, and whatever else you don't want going down your drain. I find myself having to pick these things out before rinsing the container and filter out. Btw, you also have to rinse clean the rotating brush. It takes a good 5 mins to do all this. Overall, still worth it and an awesome product.\n",
      "Slept with it for the first time last night, it‚Äôs very soft and comfortable.<br />It is not wrinkle free but I don‚Äôt mind it.\n",
      "Great product, good value.\n",
      "The factory edge is very sharp. The rounded tip actually works better if you want to use this only for bread. The serrations are beautifully finished and this being a millenia edition knife is true value for money. I gave it 4 stars since I do see the odd few crumbs even with fresh loaves.\n",
      "We used this for a Christmas party at our home. It was good quality. I will reuse it next year.\n",
      "I wish it were a bit more sturdy and came with more layers, but overall, really a great tree.\n",
      "Just wanted a small 1 cup pot. I like a cup of coffee in the evening - my husband doesn't. This works out well with me.\n",
      "Received Oct 25th 2019. Used twice, second time Dec 5th 2019. On that use error code HH.H displayed, would not reset. Company website said code means its broken, possible moisture damage. Never washed, inserted 1x into done chicken breast, 1x into done salmon fillet. REPLACED by new one for no cost which works fine. Quick resolution.\n",
      "Great product for the price!! I can't wait to get the color I need -- I made a mistake on this order, but can see that the product is of excellent quality!!\n",
      "Nice tray! Kitchen look nice and organize! Love it!\n",
      "I love this bed frame but it has some issues. 1st the metal slats are tiny and too much apart. No issues I thought, I will get a high quality slatted bed base on top of it. Well there is a problem as while I bought a Queen Size metal bed frame, its dimension is slightly less than the standard 60‚Äùx80‚Äù. It is 59.5‚Äù wide! No worry, I bought some plywood to fill the gap and put my high quality slat on top of it.<br /><br />I am not small size & weight and this metal frame does not move, nor tweak. Nothing! Great quality. Apartment cost is high in the NYC area so this high bed frame allows me to hide luggages and boxes under it. Just love it!<br /><br />5 star for the strength of the metal frame and its height.<br />2 star for its inadequate tiny slats.<br />Nevertheless, I give it a 4 star overall as I am very satisfied with the modification I did.\n",
      "Love that they burn clean and last for many hours! Once blown out, they relight easily. Burns almost all of the wax so there is very little waste.\n",
      "I love this scale... It is not fussy like my other scale was. I remember having to hit the TARE button over and over on my old scale, but this scale locks in right away. It is also of solid construction, well made.\n",
      "The construction of the boxes is very solid and durable. They are perfect for our needs!\n",
      "I love this vase. It looks just like the picture. I use artificial flowers in it and it works with a variety of styles.\n",
      "The replacement vacuum bags for Oreck Ironman are great. They stand up to the amount of pick-up with popping holes, fit well in the Ironman, and hold the dust pick-up great.\n",
      "My only issue is that this product, when in use, is SUPER LOUD, so much so that it literally hurts my ears. Does anyone else have this issue. And if so, how do they resolve or minimize the noise? Otherwise, this product performs greatly.\n",
      "Love having a mini serving set in my kitchen! Always need it when guest are over!\n",
      "This was super easy to put together. My youngest moves around a lot and if you child does too be prepared for all the noise.\n",
      "Good curtains\n",
      "I read many reviews complaining about Sunbeam customer service, but i have a different story. I purchased a king sized, microplush heating blanket in September, 2017. A few weeks ago, the item stopped heating. There were no warning symbols, etc, the controls lit up, but neither side would heat. I did have to place multiple calls to the help number before getting through, but when got to speak with them today, I explained the problem, they took down my basic information and said they will be sending me a replacement blanket within 5-8 days. I had an email confirming the replacement before the call ended. For a big company like that, i think that's pretty good service. Of course i am not happy about the quality and durability of the original blanket, but the interaction today with their help desk certainly changed my mind about doing business with them again. It flipped from a definite no to a definite yes. I'd say, give them a try. The will honor the warranty and without hassle. At least they did for me.\n",
      "One of the best purchases that I made on Amazon (and I buy a lot). I was a bit skeptical about buying a cheap vacuum because I was afraid it wasn‚Äôt going to work as good. But I was completely wrong! This vacuum is absolutely amazing! I use it to clean my couch, my area rug, my baby‚Äôs play area and on my hard wood floors. Basically everywhere. I use it almost 3 times a week and it does wonders. It picks up everything, dust, hair and even big particles. Its so easy to clean, its small and I love how everything comes apart, literally 3 in 1. This vacuum is perfect!\n",
      "Excellent quality, perfect fit for lumbar pillow, color matches brown/gold tone recliner.\n",
      "Nice, very clean appearance\n",
      "I ran out of room for my Shun knives and needed a bigger block. This one worked out perfectly.\n",
      "Great quality. Super cute.\n",
      "I was amazed at how well these little papers work to preserve vegetables. I was expecting to be disappointed but was pleasantly suprised. They kept green beens fresh for weeks (when they normally get slimey after a few days). These papers are liberating. I can buy a lot of vegetables at once now and not worry that they'll go bad before I can eat them.\n",
      "Love the rug! Its very soft and you can't beat that price!!<br /><br />My dog gives it an A+\n",
      "This is a terrific product, and I have ordered multiple times. However, most of them are really dirty, covered with brown dust and something on the feet. After a good wash, they are terrific.\n",
      "These are so gorgeous! They could be packaged a little better as 2 did break, but I received 14 total, so still the 12 as described not including the broken ones. They look gorgeous on display in my beach themed guest room!\n",
      "I use these in my son‚Äôs lunch for his ketchup and salad dressing. I put them in the dishwasher and they clean well. The lid is very secure. I‚Äôm quite pleased with this product!\n",
      "Sous Vide is easy with this container and lid. May take longer than baking, stewing, etc. but the entire item is cooked the same way, not over done in one spot and under done in another. You are somewhat limited to smaller cuts of meat, but could do a medium size whole chicken. Sous Vide method of cooking immerses meat or what you wish to cook that is held in a zipper bag under water that is then heated with the special heater.\n",
      "Love the paper, the fonts, the little drawings. I would just add more space for ingredients!\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "The print is perfect! The only reason I took a star away is because of the zipper. It‚Äôs positioned dead center on the bottom hem so it‚Äôs not very easy to get the pillow in compared to my other pillowcases. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great cover and I‚Äôd buy it again.\n",
      "These colorful neoprene bottle holders are really great got regular bottles of wine, they are too narrow for wider bottles. Forget squeezing a champagne bottle into one. They are so cute! I really wish they were a bit wider!\n",
      "Works great, durability has been a non-issue yet I'm still worried about it. I will buy again.\n"
