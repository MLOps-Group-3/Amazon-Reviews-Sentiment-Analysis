      "I ordered 12 pieces and have been great to keep my meals stored and in decent portions. I have notice that to get a good deal, you need to click the corners. You cannot simply slid your fingers around the edges due to product design and can cause a cut from the plastic. If you store meats, using a knife can penetrate the plastic, so only stick to forks or spoons. Liquids will flow into other areas of the container so add liquids when ready to eat. Containers and lids are easy to clean and dishwasher safe. These are stackable and do not take up too much room in the fridge. I've been keeping rice with chicken, peas, and boiled potatoes I these containers. I will also do different fruits as well.\n",
      "They were so beautiful at 1st. Easy to install. Put them up in May, now in September they are hit and miss. 2 Spots have stopped working so if you have the extra money buy a better set. I'm so disappointed.\n",

I am going to try and deal with the warranty because no one in the town closest to where I live will work on Dysons at all. I have never had much luck with warranties so we shall see what happens this time. I can vacuum with four strokes before it goes dead. I am very disappointed. I have pets and really thought this would be the best one to purchase. I was promised a refund. I have all the emails showing that but I NEVER got a refund and Amazon will not help at all now. Just spent an hour with customer service and it was awful.\n",

It advertised as simple and quick (3-4 weeks) and it took us more than 7! The first process takes 3-4 weeks and then to bottle and carbonate is additional 3 weeks. And tonight we finally got to taste it. It tastes like soda. So flat, absolutely no carbonation, and no beer like taste. I was really disappointed. And now there is no way to return it due to Amazon's short return window and how long it took to brew. Please invest in a different one and don't get this one.\n",
      "I brought this item twice. The first one lasted awhile but the switch off button broke somehow and the water burned out causing a burning smell.

I'd rather just continue sticking all my socks in separate laundry bags so at least they are together. Very disappointing!\n",

      "We love this liner ! I bought so many in the past that I had to throw out because they got mildew stains on the bottom I‚Äôve had this up 4 months and it looks brand new. It‚Äôs longer than the length of my tub but I actually like that because water doesn‚Äôt get out on the ends if I spray it. I have sprayed cleaner when cleaning the tub but haven‚Äôt needed to put it in the wash yet. Highly recommend. The hook holes are strong too.\n",

      "The linen sheets are soft but not really as soft as cotton and the fabric is somewhat satin like and slippery to sleep in. I tried them for a month but have switched back to my nice plush cotton sheets. The cotton is much more comfortable. Just a personal preference. I should have known since I feel the same about linen clothing. The linen sheets wash and tumble dry on low heat setting just fine. Keeping them as a back up set but may not be used as much as my cottons. Overall, not really worth the price since cotton sheets are more affordable in the first place.\n",
      "It serves the purpose of a low, two-drawer cabinet. I gave it a 4 and not a 5 because it may tend to slide when opening a drawer.\n",
      "I was a little skeptical because of the poor reviews and therefore I was prepared to spend about $60 on a different blade, but looking at the few positive reviews for this blade, I decided to take a chance and I'm happy. This is a 4 blade unit that looks identical to the one that was in the blender originally, which finally had the bearings freeze up.The new blade spins freely and the only difference I can see between it and the original blade is that the retaining nut on top is bigger.I'm making smoothies again - so I'm good - no complaints.2-year update: The blade bearings have gone out and I'm just buying a new vitamix pitcher and blade assembly now. This blade worked well while it lasted, but since it only lasted 2 years, I'm not really that impressed any more.\n",

      "THIS IS A VERY FLIMSY CAGE!! I think it was really designed for birds NOT CATS. There are 3 ladders. Cats jump - they don't walk ladders. The hammock is only big enough for a baby kitten - too small for my 8 mos old kitten. I put him in it for pic above but he jumped out of it seconds later. The shelves are so lightweight that it dips in the center when the same kitten stands on it. The advertised pic makes it look much bigger and roomier. I have 3 cats and it's VERY crowded. If I find a better cage quickly I will return this one.\n",

      "I use my NutriBullet twice a day every day. I had to buy three of these machines in as many years: every time after one year of continuous use the seal around the blades gives up. The machine itself is easy to use and clean. But I‚Äôm tired of having to buy spare parts or a new blender every 12 months. If you plan to use your blender every day, I recommend you find a better one.\n",
      "Product description said \"GLASS insert\" It came with a PLASTIC insert. For the cost of the product it should have had glass. I returned it and and purchased another same size frame with GLASS for $16.00.\n",
      "Rather very thin.\n",
      "It is warm and thick but its not warm fleece material. I also think its a bit pricey to not be fleece. Its ok.\n",
      "I noticed that this product only had one rubber in the center which translates to not very sturdy. I added my jars of pickles and mayo on it for fridge organization and it squeaks if i fill it up. I wish i had purchased Lazery brand which is very sturdy and does not squeak with all the oils and vinegar bottles on it.\n",
      "Was not as described\n",
      "Thw sucking cups dont hold more than 2 shampoos. They will slide down.\n",
      "I bought two and both drawers were misaligned on both night stands. Terrible quality control. I fixed them myself so I didn‚Äôt have to hassle with the returns, but don‚Äôt waste your money. Cheap quality and poor workmanship.\n",
      "Screw is so short cant even get it into the walI and no thread in the holdback either to screw them in. I‚Äôm returning them. Useless! Also brought a longer screw which is the right size but doesn‚Äôt fit.\n",
      "Came broken when received! Quality of plastic doesn't seem good.\n",
      "These tables are awful! They are unbalanced, wobbly and If NEVER put anything on them and leave the table alone, it would not support even a single dinner plate. Go elsewhere for this type product.\n",
      "I use this in my bathroom because I don't have much counter space. It looks great and was easy to put together. My only problem is that the wood slightly split when putting in one of the screws, but this may have been from screwing it in too tight. I have had it about three weeks now, and so far it has held up well and doesn't have any water damage from steamy showers. If I ever need another small shelf/rack for storage I would buy this again.\n",
      "Command Hooks hanging so inconspicuously in my humble bathroom are often overlooked. Yet tonight, one command hook in particular is the real MVP. Sorry I doubted you sweet command hook, but you have to know I doubted you when your mate fell so easily back in the winter under the weight of a soggy loofa. But tonight, when you saw me, a rotund and stout woman with the blood of the Irish and the strength of the Vikings, begin to fall... you said, &#34;Nope. Mrs. Humpty Dumpty will not break her knee this eve!&#34; And as I fell toward the wall, eyes wide, ass bare you latched onto my pointer finger where you held me long enough for me to catch myself on the side of the tub. You did your job you rogue command hook. You didn't let go. And though you may be sore tomorrow, this large and clumsy woman thanks you for your service. You're an absolute legend.\n",
      "GREAT more than I expected\n",
      "AS nice and comfortable as sheets 10x the price! amazing find!! Bought them for every bedroom in our house with a backup set.\n",

      "This set is GORGEOUS and incredibly beautiful!!!! It arrived in one piece and is stunning. I love the cedar wood box. The groomsman will love it! Highly recommend this product!\n",

      "My wife used this shower curtain as a backdrop for a reborn doll booth where she was selling dolls at a craft show. We added some twinkling lights behind it and it worked out great. As for use as an actual shower curtain, I really can't say, but it does look nice and festive.\n",
      "I use this item in my garage to hang coats and keep the family's lunch boxes, water bottles, school bags, etc. Best organizational product I've ever purchased and everyone who visits always asks where I bought it. It was an awesome value and I love using it!\n",
      "Fits right, feels comfortable, sheets warm up quick\n",
      "Nice wooden hangers. The slight curve helps them align.\n",
      "I need to start this with, I do not sleep well...never have. I am a restless sleeper and wake frequently. I also have trouble with becoming sore when sleeping on my side if the mattress is too firm. Historically I have preferred a super soft mattress that cocoons me when I sleep. However, progressively I have been waking in the morning with worse and worse back pain. Our old mattress was well past its prime and there were huge valleys in it (which of course was most of the problem). After extensive research on mattresses in general, specifically for different body types (I'm 5'6&#34; 140 and hubs is 5'11&#34; 210), my husband and I decided to try the Tuft & Needle. I was extremely hopeful and it has not disappointed. The mattress is firm (which typically doesn't suit me) but it's not hard...it's soft and supportive. The most exciting part for me is that I no longer ache if I sleep on my side and since owning this I have slept through the night most nights (dry winter air aside). I feel so well supported and am so comfortable on this mattress it has actually changed my sleeping habits. I now sleep on my back most often and wake rested without pain. It did take about a week for my prior pains to go away but I immediately felt them shifting and not getting worse. So far I love this mattress!!!!!! I can't speak for you but hopefully have given enough information so that if you have similar needs you will find this helpful.I won't mention my husband because he can sleep anywhere on anything at the drop of a dime (literally falls asleep in less than a minute, very annoying) The big test will be to see if over time we get any valleys.NOTE: I have only been sleeping on this for 2 weeks but will update this review if anything changes.\n",
      "They are beautiful and seamless! I love how they look and my clothes no longer slip off the hangers. Plus, they save so much space!\n",
      "Well made. Good value.\n",
      "I used these to glue onto mason jars and give away at my wedding. Everyone commented on how great the turned out. Also used for other projects, I will continue to use these for more. Love them. Great quality, super cute and rustic looking.\n",
      "Love this little vacuum for all the small pick ups, crumbs. Works good!\n",
      "Bought the whole line so all my reviews will be the same. Pros - super cute, lightweight, dishwasher safe, and dropping them probably won‚Äôt break them. Cons - they all have cracks now after one wash at the rim, not to wear you can‚Äôt use them, cosmetic only so inside the acrylic.\n",
      "I just received my fancy toaster today. I ran one toast cycle without bread, as directed, to get rid of smell. Okay. But now it won‚Äôt work. Just that fast, it‚Äôs not working. $125 for a toaster that doesn‚Äôt work. Called customer service and there‚Äôs a 35 minute wait time. Used call back option and now I wait. What a complete joke. The automatic lift won‚Äôt raise. I get a bunch of white lights and no button works. I got a call back from Breville. Here‚Äôs another issue. There is no serial number on the toaster. What‚Äôs up with that, Amazon??? I‚Äôd like a toaster with a serial number, please. toast day\n",
      "Very cheap and flimsy product, plastic & cardboard - pieces did not even snap together correctly.\n",
      "These lights are great. I have purchased from another seller before but the lights weren‚Äôt nearly as bright and the batteries did not last very long. These are much better and even come with spare batteries. GREAT VALUE FOR THE $. I definitely recommend them\n",
      "Outstanding kettle. Truly is safe and boils water fast.\n",

      "absolutely gorgeous!\n",
      "Bought for the holidays. It was perfect as we are always traveling with 2 dishes to family events. It kept one warm and the other cold with no issues, even after 2 hours. It looks nice and is comfortable to carry.\n",
      "As advertised.\n",
      "These are great and very stylish.\n",
      "A little extra weight needed as the bags have a little buoyancy going for them.\n",
      "Had this bed for about 4 months now. At first it was a little firm but woke up after the first night with no lower back pain. For someone who wakes with back pain every day for last 10 years that was all i needed to know i made the right choice.\n",
      "cool decal to add anywhere\n",
      "This is a very nice mat. I have one from a different brand that is thinner--this one is 1/8 inch thick, so it has a bit of padding and softness to it. It doesn't slip and is well made. It is basically a sample of the Mannington sheet vinyl flooring. I got the bronze/brass color because I wanted a light color. The color and pattern look just like in the picture. Because it is a light color, the pattern is not as clearly defined when you look down at it, and, as is evident in the picture, some bits are blurry--which is the style. Overall, it is just what I wanted.\n",

      "Works as expected. Fun design\n",
      "Fast delivery, good product, length perfect. Nice job.\n",
      "Perfect to put up inside a cabinet for storage / space saving areas. I used these in my bathroom under the sink on the inside of the door to hold cotton balls and q tips. üëåüèΩ\n",
      "I wish it held more bacon but does cook it perfectly with no grease.\n",
      "Beautiful decorations! Got lots of compliments on them!\n",
      "They draw the liquid well and pull the full 5ML. Keep in mind that the drop will be large as the opening. Not to be used for dispensing into a small opening.\n",

      "Comfy and cozy! Great price!\n",
      "The Antlers are not fixed to the head and have holes that they sit in, but are not secure. A slight move causes them to fall off - one of the antlers fell and broke when I picked up the statue even though I was very careful in moving it. This is disappointing as it is a nice looking statue.\n",

      "Great party pack!\n",
      "Absolutely love it. I can cook multiple things on it.\n",
      "These are so perfect for the money. Washed a few so far and no spotting or fading but I've only had them for a couple weeks so I guess we'll see.\n",
      "Bought this for the house. It's all hardwood and tile. No reason to break out the giant vacuum just to do a quick get home and pickup. For the nay-Sayers. This is not an industrial shop vac. It's a 30$ badass machine and great for dust and dog hair.\n",
      "This is my 3rd distiller, I love them, our city water is bad, I don't trust it, so I cook, drink and water plants with distilled, I make it daily and keep 10 gallons on hand always. Distilling is also good for you, but don't forget to take supplements for the stuff it takes out, if that's a problem for you. This matches my appliances also!!\n",
      "Bought these for homebrewing, and one other brand of bottles that were slightly cheaper and these bottle were a lot better. I highly recommend these bottles!\n",

      "Love love love. So soft. Nice design as well.\n",

      "Does exactly what it's supposed to do. It catches all the frothy foam from the shaking process and any pulp. It fits a Boston shaker quite nicely. The finish is quite durable as well.\n",
      "I use them to clip bags closed after opening. Like that you can use them to clip bag and then hang it on a hook to keep things more organized. They appear to be quite sturdy compared to plastic and will not grow mildew like wooden. Really like them.\n",
      "Bought as a gift.\n",
      "I gave these 4 stars on \"Wrinkle free\" because the border is not stitched flat, so it bunches up and must be ironed, otherwise it rolls and bunches into a wrinkled tube shape. Next time I change my bed, I'll tuck the top border under the bed at the bottom; otherwise, these are perfect sheets for those who prefer 100% cotton and low thread count. Also, they fit my mattress better than other brands made to accommodate \"depth\" from add-ons, such as mattress toppers. I couldn't be happier with these. Have been searching for several years!\n",

      "I decided this year I was going to try my hand at making my own wine. I'm definitely a novice. Everything I read said to rack your wine first because bottles are likely to break. I'm a little lazy and didn't feel like rebottling everything multiple times so siphoned the wine after fermentation directly into these guys, crossed my fingers, and hoped for the best. Well, it has now been several months and none of the bottles have shattered! They are made of heavy duty glass and the stopper seems to work great. I highly recommend these!\n",
      "Very good. Thank you!\n",

      "Very Comfortable.\n",
      "Great product! Added just the right touch to my curtains. Easy to hang and very good value. I recieved alot of these for the money. The same item would have been so much money in a department store. They also can be used for so much more than just curtains too. I will be using them to hang baseball caps too! I can see myself buying these again soon.\n",

      "Looks great in my sons room! Very sturdy compared to the $28 one we bought that fell apart from the weight of his curtains. Now his curtains can go around all the way to the sides to totally blackout his room. They are so nice I am considering replacing all my curtain rods!\n",
      "I bought 16 of these rods for a rental property. I see no difference between these and ones that look just like them that I purchased a year ago at a home goods store -- except that the price was about $10 per rod cheaper. Also many of the department store rods are only 3/4 of an inch rod; these are 1 inch rods! Great support systems too.\n",
      "If you‚Äôre not using these lil scrubbers in the shower, I‚Äôm hesitant to believe you are ever truly ever clean. They are the best scrubbers, textured enough to truly exfoliate and clean without feeling like sandpaper. It makes your skin so soft and this package comes with so many! They are pretty small to use as mitts if you have large hands but you can always use by sticking a bar of soap inside and using it as a scrubber that way. Long story short; buy these, they are a must-have in my shower.\n",

Took this on my trip to a Caribbean island and had it on my wrist EVERYDAY!!!!!! it was so funny because people kept asking me what the heck I was doing and why was I holding my wrist to my mouth! when they realized it wasnt just an accessory they wanted one too!!!! This item is Cute and very unassuming people will just think its a bracelet until you tell them or until they ask why u keep putting your bracelet in your mouth!!!! BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO DRINK LOWKEY!!!!!!\n",
      "Love it! I don‚Äôt have a large laundry room so this is perfect. Stainless Steel so should last a long time. The template for mounting was not in the box so mounting was a little more difficult. It‚Äôs exactly what I wanted/needed!\n",
      "Works as intended and is very light and accurate\n",
      "Really love how it blends powers (protein,collagen,pwdr milk , powder supplements etc.) together smoothly in your liquids. Easy to clean ( I rinse it & jar in cool water first , follow by soap & warm water shake , then rinsing in plane water last ) .\n",
      "Was on the hunt for drinking glasses that would be difficult for my kids to break. Sure enough, when I received them my son accidentally bumped one and it fell from the kitchen table onto the marble floor and it survived the fall without even a crack! Very good quality glasses.\n",
      "Wish I had bought it earlier this summer. Really great, even cooking. Super lightweight. No need for water to clean which was perfect for glamour camping...just wiped it clean.\n",
      "I purchased the other 3 tier one that goes in your bathroom over the toilet and was extremely happy. Got this one for my laundry room and have been really happy as well. I was a little concerned because this one doesn't have the wall anchors like the 3 tier bathroom one does, however after a couple weeks of use I haven't had any major problems. It is slightly wobbly, but that's mostly because I have all these heavy laundry detergent bottles on it. Like I said though, a couple weeks of use and no issues. For the price and purpose, Perfect!\n",
      "Very soft and can tell a big difference.\n",
      "wonderful fit, very soft and comfortable. Great quality.\n",
      "This is a professional, quality product. I had my last steamer for 17 years and used it at least four times a week. I wanted something that will hold up. The parts in this ps-937 are quality. The hose has fabric on the outside and it feels strong. Much tougher than my last steamer. The pole is light metal. I‚Äôm hoping it will last another 20 years at least. Probably not something I‚Äôd take traveling, but that‚Äôs not why I bought it.\n",
      "Value for money\n",

      "The clock looks fine and runs silent. Don't know yet if it is accurate as I just powered it up today after receiving it. The reason for the mediocre review is when I opened the clock to modify the face, I found the face to be a thin cardboard. It is likely a moisture magnet. Not what I was expecting.\n",
      "I like how soft it is, as well as the textured ‚Äòprint‚Äô to it. It‚Äôs a nice size. I wish it were a bit thicker, as it‚Äôs really quite thin for a blanket that‚Äôs labeled as ‚Äòflannel/fleece.‚Äô\n",

      "Lovely feathers and good workmanship. The colors were similar to picture, but they are a little on the dull side. They are feathers, so must be treated with some care, as they will shed a bit. Doesn‚Äôt provide a lot of cooling breeze when fanned, so expect more of a decoration than an effective fan.\n",

      "I have a set of LeCruset cast iron and a Staub grill pan so I've had some experience with enamel coated cast iron, this was my 1st non-enamel coated cookware.I've own the Lodge griddle about 2 months now. I've used it primarily on my outdoor gas grill.Likes...consistent with most cast iron cookware the griddle retains heat very well and it's evenly distributed, no cold spots. Once griddle has a nice coating of oil, and is hot, most foods did not stick and that included cooking some fairly delicate foods such as halibut cooked on high heat. Flip it over and you can get some great searing marks on steaks, burgers, etc with the ridged grill side.Comes pre-seasoned, and had nice flavor out of the box., I rarely cook over open flame on the gas grill, nearly everything on this griddle.Dislikes...the griddle side is not really smooth to the touch, it's slightly bumpy cooking surface which makes for fast and easy seasoning from the factory but not an ideal surface for foods such as eggs, pancakes. etc. Overall cleaning of cast iron cookware is harder than non stick, and this griddle is no different in that regard, but super hot water and a good scrub brush to a still warm cast iron pan cleans up nicely.Summary...solid, affordable, this griddle is a keeper. Harder to clean than my enamel coated cast iron pans, and you have to keep it seasoned, but for the money it's hard to beat this griddle.\n",
      "We were surprised at the poor quality of the bookshelf after we put it together. For the price we we‚Äôre expecting something of much better quality. The wood shelves are sturdy, but the metal bars are flimsy and cheap looking. One of the screw holes on the shelf were missing the threads so we could not screw down all four corners. For the price we suggest looking for a better shelf.\n",
      "This is a wonderful unit! It blends in nicely and does exactly what it is supposed to do. HOWEVER, be cautious. I have had this unit for 2 weeks and it has completely clogged my HVAC filter. There is a fine white dust that gets emitted from the unit and some have stated it settles on surfaces, I had a problem where it restricted 100% of the airflow into my HVAC. After calling talking with the filter company, they said that cool mist humidifiers will cause the white powder to be trapped in the filter and clogging it up. I believe you can use distilled water to help solve this issue, but that can be costly as you would need to purchase distilled water constantly. I would recommend looking into other units that are not cool mist ultrasonic as you can get around this issue with other methods. The white dust did not settle on my surfaces so I had no idea it was happening, only inside of my heating system.\n",
      "I was disappointed in the size\n",
      "Popped after 30 days of ligh, limited watering use.\n",
      "Very thin and cheaply made. Was very disappointed.\n",
      "I love the look of this product, but the warning label that says the product may expose me to chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer birth defects, etc. means I'll be returning this. Why is this manufactured or sold?\n",

      "This rug bled all over my patio after the first rain. We had to throw it out. Total waste.\n",
      "I bought this machine and LOVED it. So much so that I ordered a second one. However, my second purchase has several things wrong. It appears to have a short that is affecting several things. Leaking, lights intermittently go on without prompting, won't make coffee....just to name a few. When I asked for a replacement, the answer was \"No\". Really too bad! A devoted customer who received a bad unit is VERY disappointed. Bad call on DeLonghi's part, in my opinion. A loyal customer could have been happy with a more compassionate response. Not coming back for another as a result.\n",

Instant transformation in my living room. I paired this set with Woven Nook pillow covers on amazon and they both compliment each other so well!\n",
      "The cartoon are cute, but the quality is not as good as I expected. For this price, you can find a better one somewhere else.\n",
      "A little flimsy but if you are careful, a great product\n",
      "Love the sunrise feature of this clock. The only thing that would make it better is if it let you have two preset alarms - one for weekday and one for weekend!\n",
      "Very uncomfortable to wear at night - Did not protect the \"curliness\" of my hair. Didn't end up with frizz - but it was flattened against my head. I returned product.\n",
      "Nicely made and a good price. But I wanted a doorstop that was at least 1-1/2\" high. These were listed as such, but actually measured 1-3/8\" high. So too low to work where I had intended. Also, the rubber foot was fairly hard and will not grip on a hardwood floor very well. They tend to slide.\n",
      "Really like the shape and it's a good size for sweaters. I also love that it folds so people with small spaces can easily store it. However, where the rack folds is where it collapses when a piece of clothing is placed on it. I have had to put a small tchotchke under both of the joints so it doesn't sag. It would be perfect if there was a locking mechanism at the folding joints so it doesn't collapse.\n",
      "previous one lasted only 8 months\n",
      "Rug is okay i guess but we received both of them with dirty lines through out. Dirt may come out but haven't tried. Also color in person is much much lighter than Amazon photo. Wanted dark rugs to hide dirt but got very light ones that will show everything. Too much trouble to send back as they are 8x10\n",
      "I loved this vaccum because I have dogs and it would get under the couches and under furniture where I would have to move it. It filled up fast cause the trap is small but it picked up well. Only problem is the battery life only lasted a couple months and now it doesn‚Äôt hold a charge. Always goes green like it is charging but dies within ten seconds now.\n",

      "Super easy to install but needs optional permanent installation hardware. They slide off the shelves as you remove items.\n",
      "I like the beautiful, sleek design. it has easy to read numbers and easy to see sweep second hand. Love It!\n",
      "This is such a great wedding favor! Not the best bottle opener, but they're cute and cheap! Even though the cost was cheap, they're very sturdily made. Would buy again.\n",
      "These are a great alternative to plastic wrap and foil. The wraps are huge! Way bigger than other wraps I‚Äôve seen online and in stores. They work great for covering large plates, or large bowls. Other brands are not big enough, or you‚Äôd have to use 2 or 3 to do the same thing. I like that they are uniform in color instead of having a rainbow of colors you have to sort through in your drawer. I use them for sandwiches to take to work instead of a plastic bag. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm doing my part to help the environment. I recommend these to anyone who is looking for an alternative to cling wrap or foil.\n",
      "Just came today. Perfect in color, size and quality for the price. They will look very nice on my deck dining table.\n",

      "Great product love it\n",
      "This looks so much better in person. It has a slight gloss to it, which I like and it looks perfect on my hardwood floor in front of a bamboo sofa. The edges do not curl, it is easy to clean with a vacuum or a cloth and there was no odor. I bought rug grippers but ended up not needing them! Love this rug!\n",

      "This product was simple to set up and the buttons to operate it are very easy to use. I have mine on the highest setting and have not been bothered by the noise that others have mentioned in reviews. It is like white noise for me and helps me sleep. There is a blue night light with two different intensities. I have been sleeping better with this product but am also drinking tart cherry juice before bed so am not sure what is causing the positive effect.\n",
      "Quality construction, and boy has it helped with sleep! Getting up, not so much. :)\n",
      "Just bought these pillows earlier this week, and I have had the best sleep! I have yet to find a pillow that works for all the ways I sleep, and this is by far the best/most comfortable pillow out there. It is extremely affordable, and looking forward to many more restful nights!\n",
      "I love how big it is. Just exactly what I want!\n",
      "The desk came with a dent in one. Probably due to shipping. One leg did not line up with the screw and I had to keep 1 screw really loose o I can screw in the other screw w/o stripping the hole. I tried contacting customer service from Amazon e-mail but no e-mail was provided. The e-mail said Auxley's e-mail was deleted. I then tried calling them and the number provided was disconnected as it sounded if I was hung up when I called twice to no avail. I give 1 star and would not any of their products agan.\n",

On the negative side: the red light that hits the ceiling is brighter han our prior projection clock and there is a lot of light projected in a circular area, beyond the actual digits, which brightens the room. But we adjusted to that. The big problem with this clock is that IT DOESN'T KEEP TIME RELIABLY. Twice now it has &#34;updated&#34; itself during the night and been off by up to two hours, in both directions. My return window through Amazon has closed, but we're done with this device. It's raison d'√™tre is to tell us what time it is, and it evidently cannot do that consistently.\n",

The first night I tried to sleep on it, I could not get comfortable at all and barely slept. I woke up and my body was so sore. The second night I slept on the couch. The third night I gave the bed one more try and I couldn't sleep and woke up very sore again. Amazon was very helpful and nice. I was able to call to return the mattress and receive a refund. Unless you thoroughly enjoy EXTRA FIRM beds or weigh over 300 lbs I would NEVER recommend this bed.\n",

When I received the first one it was beautiful, I put batteries in it, go to turn it on and the toggle switch is pushed up inside so now it‚Äôs unusable. I ordered another one and was planning on returning the first one. When I received the second order, it was a completely different lamp that I paid $25 for but they were now selling for $3.99. I returned that ugly thing as soon as I could. I then checked out the first lamp and was able to fix the switch so I put batteries in it and it worked beautifully until one day passed the return date and it just stopped lighting up. I changed the batteries like 3 times and still nothing. I loved the lamp, it was perfect for when I was going to sleep. It gave out just enough light to see but not too much to keep me awake. So, I decided to order another one. I was delighted to see that they had a new aqua color choice, so I quickly ordered it. It came in today and was poorly assembled, but I know how to fix that so I wasn‚Äôt worried about that. So I turned it on and only the color changing option worked not the white light as well. So this one is being returned as well and I‚Äôm done. I reached out to the company several times and nothing.\n",

      "Love the shower curtain, but as soon as you wash it (on gentle cycle in cold water)... it shrinks almost 6 inches at the length and then 10 inches from the width. The top noticeably sags and because of this it pulls the whole curtain in, making it loose a lot of it's 72\" width. Overall it has become useless and not really functional. You can see the pictures on how much it shrank and the fact it's width condensed in. I am not holding my breath I can return it, but I did order the one that is a Polyester/Cotton blend that is 84 inches. Hopefully that will work better.<br /><br />I would recommend either (1) never washing the curtain or (2) buying a much larger size and hopefully it will shrink to fit.\n",

The plates which are supposed to be earth ware become super hot, and will burn to the touch when put in the microwave for more that 30 seconds. When we bought these, they were represented to us as Microwavable safe...but I see that they have changed this. We are not hard or abusive on tableware....I still have a set from when I was in college 20 years ago, we have had these now for a year and most of them have broken, chipped and are not whole. out of 8 place settings, I only have 3 PLATES LEFT!\n",

      "I own a discontinued Dyson slim DC 18 model. The slim is perfect in every way. Because the motor died and is no longer under warranty I CALLED Dyson and asked them if they had a model like it. The Dyson woman rep went over the models. I purchased my Dyson directly from the company.<br /><br />I asked her SPECIFICALLY if the small new Dyson came apart like the discontinued SLIM DC18model because THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME. She said yes. She lied. This vacuum is a POS and as far as I am concerned...ALL the Dysons are ruined just like Hoovers are because Dyson because they complicated their vacuum cleaners when they did not have to.<br /><br />The Dyson SLIM DC18...has 2 large plastic screws on the bottom of the motor unit so if a string gets caught...take large coin and easily turn the screws and VIOLA ...the roller and sides and everything comes apart for easy junk removal and cleaning of all plastic parts. I SPECIFICALLY ASKED the woman Dyson rep if this model did that and she said yes. SHE LIED. This new Dyson has 2 lift up thin plastic cheesy tab type things that are guaranteed to break sometime in the near future and you can bet Dyson has it rigged so you have to buy the whole larger part.<br /><br />That Dyson representative ABSOLUTELY and TOTALLY LIED to me when she said this new unit hose set up was like the old Slim model. With my slim model, I can put an attachment on the end of the extension hose and after using it to sweep the floor or reaching up to vacuum a cobweb from the ceiling, the hose with the attachment still on it EASILY slips back into the unit and I can then push on the pedal at back of unit base to lower the handle (with attachment still on end of hose) and vacuum the floor the regular way. SHE LIED TO ME. This POS new Dyson forces customers to do gymnastics with the hose by having to take it off the unit turning it around put the attachment on and when done remove the attachment and flip around the hose in some weird way so it fits back into the unit ( and now you have to find someplace to put the attachment down) so you can use it as a regular vacuum which is a TIME CONSUMING mess.<br /><br />My old SLIM Dyson DC had a pedal in back you pressed on with your foot to lower the handle so you can vacuum the regular way. This new POS Dyson has no pedal. You have to force the handle back.<br /><br />My old SLIM Dyson DC 18 EASILY vacuumed up cat food kibble. This new God awful Dyson just pushes hard cat food around in front of the vacuum. You have to pick up the machine and set in on the cat food for this crappy machine to pick it up.<br /><br />Also the old SLIM Dyson end of hose EASILY slipped into the base unit and there was a small tab to click to remove it. This new Dyson has some odd stupid way of attaching the end of hose into the base unit that is not simple and does not stay all the time. You have to play with<br /> it to get it to work. ANOTHER TIME CONSUMING WASTE OF TIME.<br /><br />I have no idea why the suction is weak when using the hose (ALWAYS HAS BEEN SINCE DAY ONE) making the unit worthless for that purpose. Bad enough the suction of this machine is not that great just using it in a regular upright position.<br /><br />I HATE THIS VACUUM SO MUCH. I HATE THE FACT THAT I WASTED HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS BASED ON A LIE THE DYSON REP TOLD ME. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DYSON AND I WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO AVOID DYSON.<br /><br />I paid around $400 for this unit and barely used it since I can't stand it. I am taking to a vacuum repairman to see if he can get the hose suction working better since it is less than a year old it is under warranty. Since he is a Dyson dealer...maybe trade it in for something else. If he won't trade it in or tries to low ball me for the price, I will ask one of my relatives or friends to smash this POS Dyson and post it on video. Not sure what music to set the smashing video to ...a song about LYING would be a start. I have never made a Youtube video in my life...but this lying Dyson company and their POS vacuum deserve a smashing video.\n",

This candle smelled like some kind of chemical crude oil or something. Not the least bit lemon or orange.

I have a toddler at home so he's rough, but he isn't rip the covers rough. It's been 3 months and it has a huge rip we don't even spend that much time on the couch.

      "I bought this Food Steamer (Bella) from Amazon on January 13, 2019. I used this product only twice and the heating element is already producing chalky elements on it and I cannot get this off even though I followed the manual for instructions for its safe use (ex. pouring water before using the machine, checking the water level, etc.). The product itself is also poorly designed with very flimsy and fragile material that could be broken easily. It is bulky and inconvenient to clean and overall a poorly designed and cheap product.<br /><br />Mostly because of the chalky material around the heating element, I did not feel safe using this steamer so I called the customer service of Bella (since it's still under the 2 year warranty). When I called the customer service line and I was in line for 10 minutes and the line disconnected after statements that went something like ‚Äúplease email info@sensioinc.com‚Äù. I think this is an overall very poor form of customer service to make the customer wait for 10 minutes only to hang up without any form of follow up plans. I am very sorry that I have to deal with this product. I emailed their customer service line in the meantime, and would like Amazon to step in to help resolve this issue. This product has been getting a lot of negative reviews, esp. regarding the heating element problem, and this is not a safe product to be sold anymore.\n",

      "This rice cooker is crap.<br /><br />First it doesn't make any 3 cups of rice - closer to 2. I put in 2 cups of water and 1 cup of rice to make 3 cups of rice and it overflowed.<br /><br />Oh, you're supposed to use the THREE QUARTERS CUP MEASURE THAT COMES WITH IT as &#34;1 8 ounce cup&#34;. Whether this could even be the Japanese definition of &#34;1 cup&#34; isn't even relevant; this is for Western consumers and the 3 cup description is criminally deceptive. In fact I've a mind to complain to the consumer fraud unit in the state where Black and Decker is headquartered. I certainly wouldn't have bought it if I thought it cooks only 2 1/4 cups!<br /><br />THEN, I merely touched the thing, and it tipped over on the counter, spilling water everywhere. The base doesn't support the bowl-shaped cooker in such a way as to prevent it from tipping over.<br /><br />I didn't buy it at Amazon - when I shopped around for a rice cooker I missed the fact that Amazon actually charges less than my grocery store - but, save your money and don't get this thing. I just ordered a 6 cup cooker, meaning of course, 4 cup, at Prime Now.<br /><br />Not the first I've heard of it; in my instructions on making sushi are plentiful hints that a Japanese cup is sparrow-sized.\n",

I know companies produce mass amounts of items and I don't expect perfection every single time, but this is RIDICULOUS.<br />For starters, on the outside, there are splotches of missing dye in the design, and the colors are not as described. I can live with it, not bad. I put it through the wash shortly after opening. After washing, I noticed the stripes are grey, and the solid side with the triangles is blue grey. The blue grey also isn't as dark as the photo, especially after washing. Yet again, it still works for me, since I wanted gray stripes.<br />However, when I turned the duvet inside out to attach my comforter, I was very upset. The corner ties are very short, and were falling apart in my fingers within seconds, fraying half way down it's length. And worse yet, 3 out of four corners had at least one tie that was sewn into the side of the duvet, and I would have to rip open the side of the duvet to get them out.<br />I didn't expect something luxurious for what I paid, but I've gotten better quality out of duvets I've purchased at Target for less than what I paid for this.

      "I don‚Äôt know how durable or easy to clean this will be. I just realized that this toaster oven only toasts and will be returning it right away. I bought it expecting it to have more than one function as advertised. I spent some time on the phone with customer service and it turns out that this toaster oven is advertised incorrectly and does not bake or broil. You can only have both elements hot at the same time. There is a broil symbol and a page in the manual about broiling. But when I spoke with Customer Service, she told me that this oven doesn‚Äôt actually do that. broil would mean that only the top element gets hot and this simply doesn‚Äôt do that.\n",

      "Ok first this thing cooks amazingly. It is easy and fast. Sleek and fits easily on the counter. However, there is several issues.<br />1. There is a screw in the bottom ‚Äúbasket‚Äù that causes any grease from food to leak into bottom of machine. Then when trying to clean that it creeps down into this two slits in the front of the bottom of the machine. There is no way to get that out. So now you have a fire hazard and a smoking machine.<br />2. Sometimes the basket will disengage from the outer basket. Well... this happened many times and the that was ultimately made me toss this thing in the trash. It fell in my foot splashing grease on my leg. Luckily I had on pants that was covering my legs. But that didn‚Äôt save my foot from a nasty bruise and burn.<br />3.

The red on the Ghostbusters logo looked brown, the sky looked grey instead of the greenish color it should be and the blue around the word Ghostbusters was white with a very faint hint of blue in it. The poster looked nothing like it does in the included picture of the listing. It is VERY grainy/poor clarity. Honestly, I could have printed this poster out better on an inkjet printer. This is what happens when you take a small picture and blow it up to poster size on a cheap printer - it loses a ton of quality and looks horrible.\n",

      "This microwave looks good and has decent specs, BUT ... beware ‚Äî as others have reported, you may experience a potentially dangerous flare up accompanied by multiple flashes and crackling sounds.<br /><br />I have had this oven for 7 months now. After about 2 months I experienced what appeared to be electrical arcing when trying to defrost a stick of frozen butter. After only a few seconds the flashes and crackling sounds started and the oven lit up inside. After reading several other reviews, I assumed this was just a reaction with the fat getting heated unevenly. I decided not to use it for defrosting or melting butter.<br /><br />Today, after 7 months of light usage, I was defrosting a small bowl of frozen blueberries, when after only 9 seconds the oven again sparked and crackled with loud sounds and brilliant flashes. No fat, just frozen blueberries. I have successfully defrosted blueberries many times in this oven ‚Äî until today.<br /><br />There is no longer a ‚Äúreturn this item‚Äù button on my order details, presumably because it‚Äôs past its return date. Given my experience and having read of the experiences of several other reviewers, I strongly urge potential purchasers to consider other units, no matter how appealing this one looks to you.

      "(update on 9/9/2021)<br /><br />I bought a replacement and will make sure I won't keep the kettle on its base, because it is the springs that wears out in the connectors.<br /><br />With the replacement, it turns out that there is a circle illuminating the kettle that never worked on my first one.<br /><br />(update on 7/05/2021)<br /><br />The unit just died. Nothing works. Please, notice that this one was operated under strict cleanliness.<br /><br />(update on 6/1/2021)<br /><br />The contact on the base is now compromised. You have to twitch it and tweak until it doesn't turn itself off well before the target temperature.<br /><br />For this, I am taking off a couple of stars.<br /><br />(update on 10/3/2020)<br /><br />My previous review said that the unit had accumulated rust.<br /><br />I would like to correct that this time.<br /><br />A new reviewer reminded me that the rust-like deposit could be simply tea, so I checked, and it is.<br /><br />I feel stupid and I would like to apologize for my previous \"update.\"<br /><br />As the item has been working fine all the time, I am now giving it five stars.<br /><br />(update on 4/11/2020)<br /><br />Sadly, the bottom plate has developed rust. Oh, well, no need for iron supplements.<br /><br />Keep wondering when the rust will create a hole, though.<br /><br />(original review)<br /><br />The only blemish in this item lies in the fact that the top interior is not stainless steel, but plastic. However, everything below the waterline is glass or stainless steel. You can adjust the temperature in five-degree increments and you can have your water ready before adding the tea (I usually screw on the tea compartment after the water reaches the desired temperature). After soaking the tea leaves, you can keep the water warm for up to 60 minutes. Although the tea compartment slides up, theoretically out of the water, by your pulling the button on the top middle, the tea still reaches the water, unless the water level is way below capacity (1.7L). The unit works flawlessly, it is aesthetically pleasing, and it looks like it is going to last.\n",

      "I got this pressure cooker in hopes to make some family recipes that I have fondly remembered and dearly missed. I started with chicken soup. When following the included directions on boiling a whole chicken, I turned the nozzle to slowly release the pressure and all started fine until the liquid inside started spewing like a volcano covering the microwave, cabinets, and ceiling and anything else in its path. I quickly closed the vent to let cool more before attempting again. It happened again so I had to take the entire pot outside to just let it spew chicken liquid all over the backyard since there was no stopping the spray. I would highly advise a pressure cooker with a rocking bell on top to stop a huge potential mess.\n",

      "Very disappointed! We've had Cuisinart products for years. The Cuisinart coffee pot I replaced this unit with, is probably 10 years old. But, thought I could create more counter space, by eliminating the regular coffee pot and the Keurig. For some reason the keurig , remained in its space for months, and we just used the coffee pot side on the new unit. I had probably only used the single serve maybe 10 times. But, wouldn't you know, when I finally moved the keurig, and started using the single serve on the Cuisinart, it didn't work! Packed it up, sent it back. Moral of this story, take out the extended warranty, and keep your old coffee makers for back up!\n",

      "I ordered this unit using Prime Now but can't seem to find a way to link here. But I wanted to warn others about this unit and highly recommend you move on to a different unit in your shopping.<br /><br />I am a coffee aficionado. My main method of brewing coffee is pour over with a Hario V60. I grind approximately 200 grams of very high quality dark beans every day for myself and family and my former grinder was a Baratza Virtuoso. I love it but I get tired of replacing the plastic components that wear out and break over time. Unfortunately it locked up bad and I cannot manage to get the upper burr removed and it appears to need a more significant repair where I need to ship it back to them. I've had the Baratza since 2013 and it gets used a lot and I looked at it like 5+ years of that much use is pretty good so maybe it's time to get something new. I was also in a pinch because nobody around me sells decent burr grinders and I needed coffee in the morning ;-). I found this unit on Prime Now with same day delivery (Amazon is cool) so I went for it. Huge mistake.<br /><br />This unit from Breville became fully incapacitated on DAY 1, FIRST USE. I still don't know what happened. I simply weighed the beans for the amount of coffee I wanted, dropped them into the hopper and fired it up. It went along OK dropping ground coffee into the container they provide (though it's quite messy and missed the hole a lot) then it made a sound that nothing in this world should make and all bean grinding seemed to stop. I stopped the unit and started to dismantle. Now I'm thinking rock or something. Mind you in 2 years of ordering and grinding my coffee from my seller I've never once had a rock (I had a few when I used to order Peets Coffee but never with my current seller) but I just figured today was my luck day. Nope no rock, no nothing. Just gummed up grounds and a terribly messy effort to unload, and clean the thing. My grind size was drip (42) so it wasn't like I was trying for Turkish or something. I ended up grinding one cups worth a few hours later and it did just fine so I was hoping that the lockup was first day jitters.<br /><br />Wake up today, same exact process and same exact results as the catastrophe on day 1. Now I'm upset. The unit will go back and I just ordered a replacement Baratza. Mind you it's going to cost me a lot more to get the Baratza but life is way too short to mess with this thing for another minute. I'm not paid by Baratza or anything to write this I'm just keenly aware of how good their product is now after trying a terrible product. I have a couple of things from Breville and they are really good but this grinder is just really bad. I ended up getting a commercial unit that's all metal (Baratza Forte BG) so hopefully I'll have fewer issues with the wear parts.<br /><br />If you still put this in your cart and are all in, take a hard look at the second picture of the burr and get ready to spend some time everyday cleaning that out. Not for me . I should have read some of the more critical reviews before buying.\n",

When it leaves its base to start vacuuming your room it'll work in a weird pattern and just do PARTIAL of the room. Before taking off somewhere else. Same thing repeated doing just partial areas and moving along. I have the same flooring throughout the house of wood flooring. Nothing dark or any of that crap that would deter it away. It also NEVER finds its charging base!! I have to use the remote to get it next to it to dock and charge. My goal was to buy a 2nd as I also have an upstairs of bedrooms and bathrooms. The 2nd one will definitely be more high end and better quality than this one. Highly dont recommend.\n",

However, my product had a 2-inch-long tear in it when it arrived (this is a solid material). No sign of damage on the shipping box. Unfortunately, when ordering from overseas returning the product would cost me three times more than the product itself. So, returning it was not an option. I'll probably order a new one when back in the states but this first order was a bad experience.\n",
      "Since I opened the package, its smell made me feel sick. The seat cushion is very thin and it is very uncomfortable to sit on it. Finally put it in trash can.\n",

      "This opener left sharp shards of metal after opening. My wife cut her finger using it. Now imagine swallowing a shard of metal or a pet swallowing a shard. Stay away from this product. It has the potential to be very dangerous. Stay away.\n",
      "Handle on spatula split. Disappointing\n",
      "This humidifier started off great. I went through two containers a day since it‚Äôs so dry during the winter here. Then after a month, I filled the tank as usual and nothing, no warning, nothing. The fan still worked but it no longer makes humidity. Don‚Äôt waste your time with this unit. I have had others that they stop making the filters for before they died. I can‚Äôt believe we only go a month out of it. Annoyed\n",
      "The item does not even work. If you fill the tank, water spills out the top. If you manage to fill the tank, once you put on the base, water spills out everywhere.\n",
      "Copper paint came off the pan after first wash before use making it unsafe to put any food on it directly. I don't want to digest chemicals that bled into my food while cooking. Crisper basket did not shed paint but did not crisp food. But I guess I got what I paid for.\n",
      "I still can‚Äôt figure out how to put this thing together so I haven‚Äôt used it.\n",
      "I typically love Melissa and Doug products, and usually chose them over other brands. However, when it comes to this table and chairs, I would recommend you look elsewhere. We are constantly having to tighten the screws as they loosen. We contacted Melissa and Doug, and they were gracious enough to send new screws. However, that still didn‚Äôt solve the issue. I think it is just a poorly made product. I will continue to buy Melissa and Doug products, but I would just like to warn against this particular product.\n",
      "Ripped when I put my laptop in. Just dropped it in normally without much force. The stitching that separates the large compartment from the small one ripped completely, so I‚Äôm left with an extra large compartment. After a few days, that large compartment is so loose that whatever I put in there sags forward and I end up kicking whatever is in there when I get out of the bed. Attached pic is a view from above with an iPad in it. You can see where the stitching ripped.\n",
      "The ottoman has a strong chemical smell.\n",
      "Please don't buy these clocks. They're cheap, I know. But they rip through batteries so fast that you won't be saving money. They lose time so frequently that I end up correcting them more of then than referencing them.<br /><br />I bought a pair of them to display the time in my city and the city of people I work with. It is so rare that I look over and see that both of them are right.\n",
      "My daughter in law loves penguins.! I got this for her as a birthday gift. She just loved it!!! It seems she loves precious moments too! I was very pleased with this experience, quick ordering, fast delivery, and shipped perfectly. I will be ordering again!!!\n",

      "Great looking HOWEVER THEY CRACK IF PUT IN DISHWASHER.<br />SELLER WILL NOT ACCEPT RETURNS as a result of cracking. Buyer beware\n",
      "Do not buy, very cheap, first problem was the salt mill consistently gets clogged, second problem is the pepper mill can not handle the pepper and broke, tried to glue back to no avail, very cheap, would not recommend\n",
      "I hate everything about this clock<br />The alarm volume doesn‚Äôt go low enough<br />The gradual light is not natural at all. It‚Äôs like headlights in you face at 6 am. The buttons don‚Äôt light up so when I wake up to the blaring alarm blinded by headlights I can see how to make it stop so I end up yanking out the plug!!!\n",

      "Yesterday my husband bit into a piece of plastic in his oatmeal. While trying to figure out where this came from, I noticed that the area that twists on the blade had broken pieces of plastic and must have fallen into the nuts. Fortunately for him and this company, he wasn't harmed.\n",
      "Received one for Christmas 2017. Loved it until the single side brewer stopped brewing. Hamton Beach replaced it in March 2018. Used it March and April. Went on summer vacation. Used 1 month after return from vacation and once again single brewer side stopped brewing coffee. Not going for a 3rd one. Looking at other options.\n",
      "Like other reviews I've read carafe side is fine but single side is junk. K-cups explode or leak out front and gives you a cup of nasty grinds. Have previous 2-way brew hamilton beach model and it works flawlessly. This one I got at xmas is a disappointment. Flawed engineering!!!! Do not buy!!!\n",
      "It worked fine for the first 2 to 3 uses - then it just broke (whisk detached from the handle)<br />I have just passed the returned window! so no luck with that either.\n",
      "Piece of junk. Returned. Barely moved air.\n",

      "This piece of expensive crap looked like it came from the $.99 store. Noone liked--I donated it to amvets.\n",
      "Scale stopped giving correct weight after 9 months of sparing usage. No ERR message appeared. The digits just keep wavering and eventually stops between 35 -39 lbs. Changed battery too.\n",
      "Very cheap material, got it cracked.\n",
      "All of mine are warped to the point that they have to be fit on the containers with excessive force.<br />Also, all the vent switches have come off\n",
      "What I want to know is why you jumped the price the other day? That just doesn‚Äôt seem right or fair to me. Shame on you.\n",
      "This was the worst product ! Waste of money I should‚Äôve paid better attention to reviews and where it says cannot be returned. How can you sell something that has sooo many bad reviews. Followed instructions still failed.\n",
      "Slippery when wet- Duh!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Do not use in shower!!!\n",
      "Just received and by chair has two small tears in the fabric. I didn‚Äôt expect to get something that is ripped. To be fair only one chair has rips but they should replace it. My option is to return the whole order (I need them now) or write the manufacturer for replacement parts. So I have to take it apart and put it back together really? Not pleased!\n",
      "Snapped after putting 3 pair of pants on it.\n",
      "These are horrible<br /> Some of the \"blossoms\" fell off in the opening process<br /> The color is a pale, pale yellow. These are the puniest representation of flowers.\n",

      "Not very durable.. mostly all the springs in the futon are already broken. Minor use only.. very cheap.\n",
      "This product discharged in my computer, caused a small fire, and RUINED my $170 motherboard, I currently cannot find a way to get in contact with someone about this. Very upset.\n",
      "Cheaply made. Didn‚Äôt work from the get go. Returning item.\n",
      "Nice looking, but it will not produce a coarse grind, making it worthless. Maybe I got a bad one. I gave it as a gift to a friend some time ago. I tried using it recently and I could barely get any grind variation other than fine. Would return but I think too much time has passed. I will look for another model to replace it for my friend.\n",
      "This is not Egyptian cotton. Tag says %100 microfiber. If I could give 0 star we would.\n",
      "Just isn‚Äôt what I expected unfortunately.<br />My makeup brushes keep falling out no matter where I move the shelf at.<br />If you don‚Äôt move it very very slow all your products fall off or over.<br />Some of the shelves are very wobbly.<br />It‚Äôs very frustrating to use and a complete waste of my money in my opinion.\n",
      "It arrived with a broken handle\n",
      "I've had two brand new examples of this product. The first didn't work right out of the box. While unpacking it, I found a little black plastic piece that was about one quarter of an incy by one half of an inch at the bottom of the box. I didn't thin much about this, but being an inveterate saver of everything, I kept the piece. When plugged in for the first time, it just didn't work. I called the 800 # in the packing and was told to return the item. At Walmart they wouldn't give me my money back, but insisted that I had to take store credit. Not happy with that but accepted the credit Then I bought a second one at Amazon. Used it once to cook some chicken (it worked well for this). After it was cleaned, I noticed a little black piece of plastic (which I saved) on the drying rack. When I tried to use it a second time, it had no power. Turns out that the little plastic piece pushes a little button in the unit to allow power. It's apparently a safety feature as the power wont turn on if the sliding drawer is not fully and securely in the main unit. Don't know how the piece(s) broke off but the unit will not work without it (them). There was a cumbersome process in returning the item, but I finally got my money back. In my opinion, the little plastic part is too fragile for even gentle normal use. If you want an air cookerk look for a different brand.\n",
      "WAY TOO SMALL!!! I expected a REGULAR full size rug. This brown rug is half the size of standard toilet rugs. CLEARLY this comes from the land of little people and little toilets. I can not use this tiny little set.\n",
      "I was very excited to get these and use them but I was very disappointed. After a few uses it was harder and harder to push the button down. They were heavier than I thought they would be but that's why them getting stuck makes it hard to use.\n",
      "I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to order this. I bought two of these, on both items the gold is chipping off all around the product. Someone else said you could pass this off as &#34;rustic&#34;, its true but you shouldn't have to. One of the holders was entirely bent and would not lay flat. My husband was able to use his tools and reshape it, but again we shouldn't have had to. This is a poor quality product that reflects its low price.\n",
      "Bad quality\n",
      "Uncomfortable\n",
      "Box showed up unopened but soap dish inside the box was opened and the waterproof command strip missing.\n",
      "I ultimately could not use these because they smelled so strongly of gasoline. It was nauseating. Even letting them air out didn't help. Also, they look cheap. The pink balloons only have polka dots on half the balloon once filled with air. The black balloons polka dots were splotchy and missing color. Total waste of money and probably deathly toxic.\n",
      "Used 5 times and it broke.\n",
      "Read all the reviews before settling on this particular one but it just isn't working as well for either myself who is 5'6&#34; nor my husband who is 6'0&#34;. I do have a shorter torso and don't even know if that matters. We bought two for the car and for sitting at home. In our chairs at home they work somewhat well, but in the car it is not a good fit. I don't even know how to describe it. I feel like the cushion makes my body come forward too much and I can't get the seat position right so that I can drive comfortably and for my feet to hit the pedals well.\n",
      "Doesn‚Äôt work at all - won‚Äôt grip lids.\n",
      "Easy to inflate, but it lost air even before we tried to sleep on it. Then...slow leak all night - had to inflate again twice. Also, no way is this a queen.\n",
      "This mattress topper is terrible. The feathers bunch up around the edges and it‚Äôs like your laying on nothing.\n",
      "This product works, but is very flimsy and I do not expect it to last very long. The pictures make it look like you are getting a stacking system of 3 levels - but read the fine print - you are buying them one at a time. The price would have been OK for 3 trays - but was too much for the single.\n",
      "Mine arrived very bent.\n",
      "Two days after this arrived in the mail, our three year old mermaid fairy princess tripped and went face first into a fireplace hearth. Three stitches later and we're throwing this one away. The craftsmanship seemed ok, but a hazard for our three year old.\n",
      "Looks way better in picture than it performs: Keys still slide all over the place. The bolts connecting the side plates together don't stay tight, resulting in your keys spilling all over the place. Not worth the money.\n",
      "after having had this for a few months standing on it about 2 hours every day i just feel that it is not comfortable still, granted i stand on it with bare foot but it should still give me some comfort, my kitchen mat i got from costco for 15 bucks gives me a better comfort than this piece of crap\n",
      "I bought this because I wanted a small toaster oven. It is terrible and now I am looking for another toaster. When I use the oven, I often burn the item; not having a timer is a detriment plus the item is too close to the heating element. Then there's the toaster that doesn't work well either. The bread often falls through. Do not buy.\n",
      "Completely different chair arrived. No foot rest, doesn't lay flat, no adjustable arm rests, horrible pleather. Not like the image at all. Want a refund.\n",
      "Backing came off in a month\n",
      "The warmer plate kept the coffee very warm. The issue was that it automatically turns off after 20 mins (regardless of heat level) and does NOT turn back on. This is the opposite of the product description. The vendor also confirmed this is not how it should work and sent a replacement. The 2nd unit operated the same way. They need to update the product description. Too bad, I liked how it warmed the brew.\n",
      "I received my Ovente 1.7L Electric Kettle today and was so excited! I had researched many on Amazon prior to purchasing and definitely wanted a red one (I do like the color). I followed the instructions to boil 2 cold water cycles. I used filtered water for both cycles and spots and discoloration began to appear after the first cycle. The 2 inside pictures were taken after the second cycle. They are IN the stainless steel, not something that can be wiped off. Nor, in my opinion, should I have to do a vinegar cycle with a brand new (at least I'm assuming it was brand new and not a return) kettle. I'm so very disappointed!\n",
      "This pillow is way too full of stuffing. Your chin will be kissing your chest. But it makes a great cat bed üòâ\n",
      "I ordered first in a king and loved it. Ordered a 2nd for our queen bed and the staining reviews were correct. Received stained sheets.\n",
      "Its okay product\n",
      "These melted the first time we used them to take a pan off the grill. Ok for light use.\n",
      "cut my finger. Blunt!\n",
      "Very cheaply made\n",
      "The hose at the base of the handle split after 11 months. The plastic flexible hose is too short to easily snap the handle back into the spot where it suppose to go when you store it. I actually thought the clip on the housing would snap months ago because of the awkward angle it went back into the bracket. This morning the clear hose split when my wife tried to put it away after using it.\n",
      "This bag was described as HEAVY DUTY. It was thin and the tree branches broke through. The garbage bag at my office is heavy duty and items cannot pierce it. My Christmas tree was 7 feet so I expected as advertised that the bag could fit a tree up to 9 feet. The bag was not long enough to cover my tree. In fact the package shows that the bag is 90 in. Height (7.5 feet). This did not work out.\n",
      "You can't even fit a sandwich in it. Maybe a good pencil case. Do kids even know what that is these days?\n",
      "I am strongly suggest NOT to buy Alfawise X5 robotic vacuum cleaner. I lost the money, it worked only two (2) times and electronically failed, Bad product! Wasted money! Stay away from piece of garbage!<br />Joe\n",
      "Heater barely works, spend the extra few dollars and get a heater that will actually work.\n",
      "This product broke after less than 60 days of occasional use.\n",
      "The bookcase was not very sturdy. It is now in the trash\n",
      "The mug arrived with the handle broken in 3 pieces. Too much of a hassle to return.\n",
      "This makes your water somewhat taste like coffee. I have even poured the first brew back in, to filter through coffee a 2nd time and there is a slight change but not enough to say you are drinking coffee.\n",
      "I have followed the directions perfectly. There is no way this will adhere to the tile or to the wall. The only thing it will stick to is the sink and that is useless for a toothbrush. Disappointing. I know it was inexpensive but was still hoping it would work.\n",
      "Handle became detached on first use. It's held on by a couple of pins that have no grip into the case. The rest of it is cheap construction too.\n",
      "Although I thought it was beautiful- the first time I fluff dried it with no heat it burned in one spot- the second time it melted in some spots.\n",
      "Very small and arrived broken ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n",
      "over half of them were broken upon receive\n",
      "Assembly was going well until I got to the base. After putting the base section together, taking it apart and putting it back together again several times (thinking I must have done something wrong), base is uneven and wobbly, even after using the longer screws, as one reviewer recommended. I can get my entire finger under the foot on the \"short\" side. I would have to put something 1/2\" or larger under one leg to make it even.<br />I like the sturdiness of the rest of the item and really wanted this to work, but am disappointed and now have to spend another 1/2 hour taking it apart and trying to repackage it to return.\n",
      "Single serving pouch. Seems flimsy. Save your money.\n",
      "Didn‚Äôt like it. Spring broke after using\n",
      "Even though my pressure cooker was listed this was too small.\n",
      "This vacuum was decent when we first received it. I used it almost daily, mostly on hardwood floors, to pick up small crumbs. As other customers stated, you have to frequently unscrew 6 screws from the bottom to clean out the tunnel in order for the vacuum to continue to function properly (this is a huge pain). Then after about 6-7 months, the vacuum completely stopped picking up dirt. It is now worthless and just drags crumbs around the floors. I am highly disappointed since I did a lot of research on cordless vacuum options prior to purchasing this one. I trusted Hoover's name, but will never purchase another one after this experience.\n",
      "The cups are hard to remove from the pan after the eggs are cooked. I have tried several different ways to extract them and still don't have a solution. A total waste of money!!\n",
      "when inflated for the first time it looked great and after 10 minutes the back and sides began to deflate and inflate again many times and squeeze all the valves and even then it did not work, what a pity, I do not recommend it\n",
      "Frame came broken the first time, and glass inside the frame the second time. Thankfully I was able to make one good frame out of it, but didn't appreciate the hassle.\n",
      "This would be great if it was bigger. Most new wrapping rolls are longer than this case ;(\n",
      "Walmart has better quality for less price!\n",
      "This pillow never got to 2.75 inches. It is very thin. I would not buy this again. I ended up putting both in one pillow case.\n",
      "It was pretty disappointing to get this in the mail. Great idea, with typical poor follow through. It was actually on the pricier side so I thought the quality would match but it doesn't. Cheap, hollow plastic with a graphic which was slapped on, poor paint job, multiple spots where the paint didn't take. Pretty much made in china garbage.\n",
      "Worst vacuum ever. Hose continually kinks. On off button doesn't hold has to be pressed multiple times to engage. Dual attachment is ineffective. I do not recommend this purchase.\n",
      "The lids don't fit. You struggle to get them to latch on all sides. I actually broke one as I tried to make it fit. And I wasn't even pushing on it that hard! As I was taking them out of the box, the lids were sticking so bad, that one of blue rubber pieces got ripped as I tried to take the lid off. The actual containers aren't bad. They clean easy, and can handle the dishwasher no problem. That's about all they got going for them. So they're great, as long as you don't actually want the lids.\n",
      "Do NOT buy! The rubber ring around the top of the lid ALWAYS falls out and it‚Äôs nearly impossible to close one side on all of the dishes. So I e d up putting stuff in my fridge with one side not closed and locked. Hate these.\n",
      "The lid is stuck and does not open. Ridiculous.\n",
      "We love the shape and size of these glasses. Unfortunately, about half of them have broken within the first 6-8 months due to the very thin walls. Glass doesn't seem to be well tempered or thick enough, so slight bumps or too much pressure on sides cause them to crack very easily. Will not buy again or recommend.\n",
      "Product description states it is a 100 piece package however the package actually contains 10 of the liners<br /><br />The product itself is probably OK - not much could be wrong with a piece of paper with holes in it. Will not purchase again\n",
      "Heavy black dyes permanently stained my bathtub. I spent nearly $100 in various cleaning solutions and attempts to try and scrub the dark staining on the tub. Went so far as to try a scour stick that basically polishes off the stained layer. Ended up having to replace the bathtub and get rib of this liner. Only buy if you're one of a handful of people with a black bathtub. Maybe try washing several times in hot water to see if you can get all the dye out before using. Unless you're in the market for a new bathtub, avoid.\n",
      "the product was scratched and two of the kisses have hard part of their color worn off. It appears they are used.\n",
      "I'm very disappointed. Her cheaply made and some of the parts are tarnished. This is for a law school graduation and feel bad to have to use them\n",
      "Similar to the experience that other purchasers have had, one of the electrical elements is overheating and melting through the plastic base. I've only had the kettle for 6 months and used it about 4 times a week. Amazon should remove this product from their site as it is unsafe.\n",
      "The edges are sharp and not finished\n",
      "Is not at all what I expected, cheaply made\n",
      "Looks nothing like the picture and the one I received was broken in the box. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "Brought this as a gift for my 87 year old mother and she LOVES this blanke! She turns it on 15 minutes before she heads to bed and when she crawls into bed, it‚Äôs toasty warm. Later during the night, if she feels too warm, she has no difficulty rolling over & turning the temp down a bit. Nice product and a lovely color.<br /><br />Update: Briught this for Xmas 2017. It is now December 2018 and it no longer works! üôÅ. It was toasty for the 11 months that it worked, but for the price paid, I have to revise my review to a single star.\n",
      "I got it but never worked... wont hold pressure\n",
      "Too thin and when you rollover when you‚Äôre sleeping in the sheets come off the bed\n",

      "Handle falls off Constantly and doesn‚Äôt ever seem to work right\n",
      "I'm currently trying to return this product due to the odor. I tried to air it out in the room with windows open and fans blowing for over a week. Moved it to the garage for a week, and the mattress still causes my sons room to smell. It is somewhere between a chemical and musty odor. The odor even permeated the carpet and his clothes, it is that strong.<br /><br />I might be the 1 in 100 buyer that has this issue, but that's high enough chances to where I would not purchase this product or accept a replacement.\n"

I had it on the finest grind, and it got stuck day one, so I set it back one and no problems since. Plus, it measures for me. 4.5 is perfect for my needs, and the hopper holds more than a week's worth of beans.<br /><br />I'm so thankful not to have to push down the inconvenient plunger on a Capresso blade grinder--which, by the way, necessitated I do 2 batches: dump the uncompressed ground coffee into the lid, to dig out the fine grind stuck in the bottom, then finish grinding the rest...a painful mess, every single day). I even had a special spatula I used to keep from dulling the blades with metal.\n",
      "I was so excited about this! I had high expectations but I shouldn't have. The frame is quite flimsy and one of the pieces came bent, I had to bend it to make it connect correctly. Assembly was simple, even though it was not in English the pictures were detailed. After it was put together (took me about 30 minutes) it served it's purpose. I wouldn't pay $56 for it if I saw it in store.\n",

I'm not fond of this coat rack but it is usable for now and I didn't want to spend more than $20. The rack is wobbly and I tried as much as I could to redo the screws with no luck. So, I'll have to put a 1/2cm of felt underneath one of the legs to level it. For my coat rack I received, there were 2 screws that would not, for the life of me, go into the holes. The top decorative piece did not go in and a screw for one of the lower hook didn't either. I tried lightly tapping with the hammer but those 2 screws won't budge. :-( I had no missing pieces, it just dint go together as I would like and is lopsided.

(gave up put it away the boys were upset) This past weekend my brother took it out and had it in the pool again with the boys it was fine no issues and they had a lot of fun.

      "The rod seems sturdy enough. Mounting isn't complicated. Finial is very pretty.<br /><br />I am the one who puts all our things together and mounts them. But there are no holes in the end of the poles to screw the finials into. Easy as pie, said another reviewer. Just push through the plastic. I have been trying to make the first hole now for 15 minutes. I used a stilleto. Hole, but won't admit the screw. Used screwdriver. Won't admit the screw. I'm about to try a knitting needle. Ok, knitting needle worked. I hope you have one. But really, it should not be this difficult to do. The hole in the plastic should at a minimum be started for you. No, darn it. The hole in the middle should be clean.<br /><br />Screwing the finial in now takes a lot of pressure because it doesn't want to properly seat. Are we having fun? Great, pressure used to screw in the finial slightly warped the end. But at least now the inner pole doesn't slide out like butter on a hot griddle.<br /><br />I opened my size 36-72\" . They make 72\" with a 3\" overlap in the middle.<br /><br />For this price I don't expect marble. I do expect to not have to go through this for a stupid piece of plastic!

      "I purchased a Mr. Coffee Steam Espresso System with Milk Frother for a friend about a year ago and was really impressed with the quality and functionality. So I decided to finally replace my old Krups espresso maker. Regretfully, this one is not of the same quality as the Mr. Coffee unit I previously purchased for a friend. Although functional, every visible component is of cheaper quality in comparison to the unit I purchase before; i.e thinner and lighter materials and a smaller unit overall. Being a pressurized unit while in use, I hope these materials will hold up and not explode on me! Had I realized this was not the same unit, I would have made a point to discover the model number of the other one. Who would have known that Mr. Coffee would deceptively make two almost identical units and make one using lower quality materials. I will be scratching Mr. Coffee off my trusted brands list!\n",

      "UPDATE<br /><br />I‚Äôve found that in order to get a drink that is hot rather than warm, I have to run an empty filter espresso shot through before making my drink.<br /><br />Short version: You might find the porta-filter to be too small, or the milk/coffee ratios not to your liking. But perhaps you can fix that manually. I wound up buying an additional portages-filter, and using both. First, I run a one shot cappuccino through, then I run a double shot espresso. You could probably do this by swapping out the filter baskets, but it's a lot easier just to have two portas lined up.<br /><br />Details: I bought a refurbed Barista and have been messing around with it for a couple of days. I bought it to make lattes rather than straight espresso (I am not an espresso fan). I just like strong coffee with hot milk, as I learned on a recent trip to Italy where I was served that every morning at breakfast.<br /><br />I previously bought a cheap espresso machine, & have been making myself a latte each morning by adding microwaved milk. But I have learned that I like foamed milk, not just heated milk, & I have also learned that using a foaming wand to make it is messy. I have also learned that cheap espresso machines deliver unpredictable results, even if you pay close attention to all the measurements involved for amount of water & coffee.<br /><br />I bought this Barista machine because it promised foaming without the mess, predictable quantities of coffee & milk without needing to measure, automated cleanup of the wand, & a container for the milk that does not have to be poured each morning. Also because I got it for 60% off by buying a refurb.<br /><br />This machine's programmed features do not provide me with my desired ratio of milk to coffee, in the total amount I want to have in the morning. Although a double latte provides me with a large enough drink, it's short on coffee flavor & in order to bring it up to where I want it to be, I have to reload the porta-filter & make another shot of espresso to add, while my drink is cooling off.<br /><br />The point here is that the filter is too small - it only has room for one scoop of coffee, which probably works well enough for those little bitty cups of espresso people like, but does not allow for making decent sized lattes which are anything more than coffee flavored milk, at least if I am relying on the programmed latte button. So you can't juice up your latte by simply adding more espresso to the filter.<br /><br />There is, however, a manual workaround that delivers the goods. If I just separately make the foamed milk first, to the desired amount of milk & degree of foam, and then run a programmed double shot of espresso, I can create exactly the ratio of milk to coffee that I want, and have an acceptably sized drink.<br /><br />This is possible because the machine permits the user to produce only foamed milk, and to control the degree of foaming. The feature is described as being for adding additional milk to a drink, but it works just fine to start off with first adding the milk to the cup, then running the espresso. You have to watch the process in order to turn off the milk when you have the amount you want, but I've learned to listen to the pump pulses, and turn off the process when it's had a specific number of pulses.<br /><br />To start the manual milk delivery, you press & hold the Cappuccino button about 3 seconds. To end the delivery, you press the button again.<br /><br />For my taste, I use a decaf French dark roast coffee pre-ground for espresso. Part of my issue with the programmed latte may be that I'm using decaf. It might be delivering a less strong espresso than regular does. Or it might be that I don't grind my own beans. In other words, YMMV.\n",

      "Mattress arrived at 4:34pm, had it unrolled at 5:31pm. Originally had it upside down and at 11:30 PM flipped it right side up. Thats when I noticed a black mark in the middle of the top side. I removed the zip cover and the black mark was on the mattress itself however not as prominent. Another notable factor was indeed the smell. Immediately after removing the plastic package I smelled an unfamiliar stench. Definitely not green tea but it didn't smell like mold either, just obnoxious and foreign to me. Now, 6 hours later it's not as noticeable but I may have just gotten used to it. Not sure what I'm going to do about any of this but definitely worth a mention.<br /><br />24 he UPDATE: the smell is completely gone and the black mark washed out (mostly) from the zip cover. I do not think it was mold. More likely it was snagged on a piece of machinery.\n",

      "Sturdy nice coffee table. I would give it a 3 1/2 out of 5 if possible. Half a star docked for it coming with a 3&#34; scratch on the top and 1 star docked for one of the screw holes being to big for the screw. The screw didn't strip, the hole is just to big for it so not sure how that works. Still seems sturdy so I'm not going to bother boxing it back up and sending it back. Overall a nice cheap table. You won't find a better one in a store for the price of this.\n",

      "This is my third one as the others leak after some time. I like the one-handed ease of use. Just press and hold the button to drink. Even though this one allows for access inside the cover, it's not easy to clean. The sipping hole gets yucky and is not the easiest to clean. Also, and a problem I had with the others is that it's typical to find little black floaties at the bottom when I open the lid. Even with this new one that hadn't had a chance to get moldy yet. My husband thinks it's flakes from the lid so we're probably ingesting plastic. Not so good. (Mine is a stainless one so it's not from paint. I only drink water from it so it's not from coffee/tea stains.) Next container will be another Kleen Kanteen.\n",

      "The seller is great first of all. The shipping time was fast and the order was so neatly packed. I only had an issue with this brand of incense.

No. These are just as fragrant as the junk that you can get at Wmart. Very disappointed. It almost seems that these are cheap imitations.

      "Reviews of this rug said it was soft, etc but I find it very thin and hard. I guess I'm used to wool rugs but I had high expectations for this since reviews seemed good, but it's just an average rug in my opinion. The quality of an average Walmart rug. It's curly but I'm hoping it'll lay flat, have a box on the corner (see photo). Am concerned about the kids tripping on corner by the door but I might get some rug tape. Hoping it'll last a few years. It's in a guest room so won't be high trafficked. Really dislike the nylon edges, they always unravel, hoping this one won't. Will leave an update in a few months!<br /><br />Update: Been about a year and rug eventually lay flat but has become matted and even more hard. Surpringsly the nylon edges have held up and have not unraveled. Looks dirty though, even with regular vacuuming. If it wasn't such a pain to haul bed out and shove another rug underneath I would do it. Hopefully I can replace it eventually but I'm living with it for now.\n",

I like hard boiled eggs so i followed the directions but the eggs were still very soft. I was unpleasantly surprised by how off the timing was in the manual. My husband likes poached eggs but they turned out really bad usung this eggmaker. Luckily it was returnable :)\n",

      "I had similar results to others, trying to simply use it out of the box failed with anything like an egg. Heat, add butter or oil, add egg, insta-stick and a huge mess. :( Other things like ground meat, etc did the same, even after repeated use. So after a year or so decided to smooth it out. Started with 100 grit sandpaper, then 600 wet, then 2000 wet, then finally finish with toothpaste. Then did a light seasoning in the oven. Well, it is finally working as I like, fried eggs will now slide around smoothly if I give them a little initial push, impossible before. So I guess you get what you pay for, this is less $ than a smooth \"grey\" metal pan, so there. I don't understand how they make these, as the steel under the coating has an almost \"spray texture\" that you have to sand through to get smooth. You can see after polishing how it has a mottled appearance from this texture. The factory coating is horrible, akin to sprayed on black paint which flakes easily.\n",

      "I am a big fan of cast iron and really enjoy this pan. I've had it for a few years now. This pan is actually just the right thickness the iron is not too thick therefore not too heavy. The handles are stylish and practical.<br /><br />When I first got it I forgot how to bake in cast iron. So I often would put a dough into a cold pan and my bread would stick and cleaning was no fun. The trick with any cast iron, especially new one that still has nooks and crannies, is to warm up the pan first. I do this as I am warming up the oven. When the dough is placed into the cold pan it has time to go into all the crannies and create a deeper bond with a pan, so to speak. :-) However, when the dough is placed into a warmed up pan it sizzles and immediately forms a crust. Popping out bread and cleaning afterwards is a breeze.\n",

      "I was very nervous about ordering this rug. Prior to ordering it, I had ordered another &#34;ivory&#34; rug from a very popular rug maker that name starts with a &#34;S&#34;. That rug was ok, but not what I wanted. It was suppose to be an ivory (mix of ivory and silver) distressed rug, but looked more black and white. It did look nice, but not what i knew in my head i wanted. I couldnt believe how hard it is to find a true ivory rug with beige hues. It was also too big. Overstock was great and let me return it for free. I wanted a true distressed neutral rug with hues of beige and creams. Then I found this rug! (I bought the 6x9, not sure why it says I have a 5x8. I do not) From the pictures, it was exactly what I wanted, but I was nervous because pictures can be deceiving. But the rug arrived and looked exactly like the picture. The quality seems great. It is a thin rug, but thats what I wanted and its not paper thin. The pattern is very subtle, but there. The fibers were already laying a certain direction, and the rug looked even lighter and closer to the picture. But I took a broom and swept it the other direction and the colors and pattern came out just a little more, still leaving the distressed look. I love the fridge edges. They add a little more class to an already classy rug. One end of the rug was curled when I first unrolled it. I evened the rug out and placed my chair legs on the very edges of the rug to hold it down. The next morning, the rug was laying flat on its on. I did not get a rug pad, and tested this rug for slipping. It does not move. I do have it under my dining table and chairs, so not sure how it would perform in another area with no furniture on it. Thats all I can think to tell you about this rug. It is BEAUTIFUL and at this price, you cant beat it. I just moved, so Im decorating a new house. Im thinking about doing youtube tutorials for each room. I havent decided, but ive added a picture here so you could see the rug in my dining area. The room is not finished. I will be adding accessories to the dining table and buffet table, and maybe a plant in the corner, but just wanted to share an image with you guys to give you an idea. I cant believe in this day and age, more people arent adding images.\n",

      "They matched my daughters theme perfect\n",
      "good for keep at home for family\n",
      "KNife is good and sharp as this price, kNife is well finish from the spine. The price you pay is worth what you get. But the handle is slippery could be better.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Love everything about this can except for the closing mechanism- you have to make sure you lay the bag just right against the lid or the lid won‚Äôt close- Although it‚Äôs a very night trash can, I think it‚Äôs overpriced\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "Brought back fond memories of days gone by.<br />Good quality construction.<br />Inscence not as good smelling as I remember.<br />Scotch tape holding roof on for shipping left tape residue and lifted finish.\n",
      "It seems like it has issues reading under 100mg.\n",
      "Love this and for the price!\n",
      "I bought these as a gift for a friend. On receipt, I checked to make sure nothing was cracked / broken during shipping but these are well packed. Everything looked perfect. I picked one up and it was quite heavy and felt good in the hand. My friend really liked them as well!\n",
      "Good product. Very durable\n",
      "Cool tray if you want one with the American flag\n",
      "Overall I like it a lot. It looks classy and has lots of options to hang stuff.<br />If one of the shelves was a bit wider it could fit a soap dish sitting flat<br />and I would like the suction cups to be movable to adjust to avoid tile joints.<br />I'm glad I bought it.\n",
      "Had to return it but it is beautiful well built...\n",
      "It‚Äôs pretty and does what I need it to do\n",
      "Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the table and finish. A good bargain\n",
      "Sturdy. Useful to mix dough\n",
      "No retractable cord feature. Kinda cheaply made.\n",
      "Cute, flowers a little cheap. But it‚Äôs cute.\n",
      "The fabric has a weird feel to it. I can‚Äôt explain it. It looks great though\n",
      "The product is great but the table is slightly damaged in shipping..\n",
      "I was disappointed that the picture showed 3 towels and we only got one. They were a gift.\n",
      "Love these coasters. The marble design matches perfectly with my living room and love the softer material of them. One thing I will say is Bc of the material sometimes the bottom of my glass will stick to it. Good value for the price.\n",
      "Sturdy spatulas. Clean good. Don't put in the dishwasher.\n",
      "Easy to operate\n",
      "Bought these a few years ago and needed to replenish our set. Was a little nervous about ordering glasses online. These were packaged very well in thick cardboard with dividers between each glass and underneath in between each size so no broken glasses! These are an exact match to the remaining few I had left from previous purchase. Very impressed! We loved having the 3 different sizes of glasses so trying to find another set at stores was hard until I found this on here.\n",
      "Love it used everyday since it arrived, will update as needed if anything goes wrong but very pleased so far, did a tri tip, skirt steak, chicken breasts and have reheated leftovers with all great results. Checked temp with instant read and it was spot on.\n",
      "Love it! I really like that it made my mattress feel more firm due to all the supports. :) Also very easy to put together!\n",
      "Protects while allowing the beauty of the table to show through.\n",
      "This was easy to assemble myself and extremely sturdy. Delivered on all its promises. Great buy.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "I just steam ironed this bad booy and he's handsome and ready for halloween\n",
      "Made well but is not soft at all. Colors are a little more muted than the photo. Price is too high for the product.\n",
      "Item seem to be of good quality, however my one was slightly bent\n",
      "Decent towels. Not the best towels I have owned, but they are up there.<br /><br />Note that best absorbency is best after about 2 washes. Our of the box they are terrible, but get better after a few washes.\n",
      "Beautiful but pricey\n",
      "I recieved so many compliments on this item. Out it together myself in about 3hrs, not complicated just time consuming.\n",
      "I ordered 2 of these for my kids bedroom. Fairly simple to assemble. First one went together without issue. The second desks right drawer had the rails that came riveted on the metal unlevel. Because of this the right drawer was crooked and wouldn‚Äôt shut all the way. Instead of going through the hassle of shipping it back and dealing with that, I measure a 1/2 inch down on one side of the drawer and drilled new pilot holes and remounted the drawer rail. Closes fine now.\n",
      "Nice sheets and they arrived the morning after I had ordered them the night before. My only suggestion is that with the split king and other kings sets they include 4 pillow cases rather than two.\n",
      "I like buying cheap nonstick cookware that I can throw out when it starts sticking.\n",
      "Order for the Thanksgiving Holiday. Great price and package comes with every piece that you would need to cook a meal.\n",
      "Perfect size jars with screw on lids. Lots of labels included too! I'm going to buy more!\n",
      "Great as usual\n",
      "I am a big fan of cast iron and really enjoy this pan. I've had it for a few years now. This pan is actually just the right thickness the iron is not too thick therefore not too heavy. The handles are stylish and practical.<br /><br />When I first got it I forgot how to bake in cast iron. So I often would put a dough into a cold pan and my bread would stick and cleaning was no fun. The trick with any cast iron, especially new one that still has nooks and crannies, is to warm up the pan first. I do this as I am warming up the oven. When the dough is placed into the cold pan it has time to go into all the crannies and create a deeper bond with a pan, so to speak. :-) However, when the dough is placed into a warmed up pan it sizzles and immediately forms a crust. Popping out bread and cleaning afterwards is a breeze.\n",
      "I always had allergies but then I moved to socal and all of a sudden wildfires are blasting smoke all over town so I buckled down and got this thing. So far it seems like it works. On the lowest air setting its nice and quiet. My favorite part is that you get a free air filter replacement if you leave a review on amazon.\n",
      "Very happy about this purchase, nice product.\n",
      "It was fairly easy to assemble and does it‚Äôs job .<br />It‚Äôs not the most attractive, but it‚Äôs inside my closet so it works well\n",
      "Works great but beware it‚Äôs not battery powered! Still love it\n",
      "I've used this Meat Thermometer for two years, and am quite pleased overall. It's durable, has amazing battery life (I store it with the battery NOT installed), and a clear display. Lately, I've been getting some odd readings, though, so contacted ThermoPro. Despite the fact that I purchased this device two years ago -- and it's LONG out of warranty -- they quickly offered to send a replacement probe free of charge.<br /><br />Amazing customer service!\n",
      "The heating is great, control is good too. The only thing I could say I did have an issue with is I could feel the heating wires, and while unlike a heating pad these do not get hot only warm, it was the actual (think the pea under the bed) feeling of wires under my fitted sheet that bothered me. Otherwise I still use it and let me tell you, nothing beats crawling into a nice toasty bed during the chilly winter months! And for the price you will not find anything better.\n",
      "Really love this clothing hanger but as many have pointed out, the clothing rack is relatively easy to assemble but because of poor instructions I had to redo a few sections which doubled the amount of time it should've taken.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Bought this for my kids school, seemed pretty sturdy so it should do the trick.\n",
      "Well made just as good as the expensive ones\n",
      "I really like this clip on strainer. Before having this clip-on strainer I tried holding the pot lid at just the right angle to drain off water and would inevitably lose a lot of the food from the pot into the sink. That doesn‚Äôt happen anymore. So easy to use and clean. Just a great asset to my cooking enjoyment.\n",
      "I just put up some rib eyes ,I buy when on sale,The bags just make it so easy to get ready for freezer,and very easy to tell what is in package\n",
      "[[VIDEOID:451eede7410ab5ab7a2410bc9db74771]] They are beautiful, easy to ensemble. You can control both of them with the same control.. I might buy extra flowers to add some color..\n",
      "Party\n",
      "Works great. I take to the gym for hangin towels in the shower\n",
      "Love these! Wish they were a little smaller to fit my handle but overall good quality!\n",
      "The color is very bright.\n",
      "[[VIDEOID:a7c41c63f04a3d2c29e0935017cd9a93]] Magari mid century Modafyed Sofa. I like the balance of functionality and aesthetic. The fabric seems like it will hold up quite well. It's not over built but it's certainly not under built either. The back support doesn't go as high is the couch it's replacing. But I don't think that'll matter. Not having a fifth leg was important in my buying decisions as I needed something I could replace legs with casters. Mid century modern design is perfect for substituting six-inch casters for the legs using the bolts provided. As the video shows.\n",
      "This thing is pretty awesome. I hate mopping so this makes it less painful to keep my tile and hardwood floors clean. The only reason I deducted a star is because it won't scrub you floors like you could manually and cleaning the product is a bit of a pain. You should clean it after every use, unlike a vacuum. Plus you can't just dump it out in the sink cause there'll be hair, fuzz, and whatever else you don't want going down your drain. I find myself having to pick these things out before rinsing the container and filter out. Btw, you also have to rinse clean the rotating brush. It takes a good 5 mins to do all this. Overall, still worth it and an awesome product.\n",
      "Slept with it for the first time last night, it‚Äôs very soft and comfortable.<br />It is not wrinkle free but I don‚Äôt mind it.\n",
      "Great product, good value.\n",
      "The factory edge is very sharp. The rounded tip actually works better if you want to use this only for bread. The serrations are beautifully finished and this being a millenia edition knife is true value for money. I gave it 4 stars since I do see the odd few crumbs even with fresh loaves.\n",
      "We used this for a Christmas party at our home. It was good quality. I will reuse it next year.\n",
      "I wish it were a bit more sturdy and came with more layers, but overall, really a great tree.\n",
      "Just wanted a small 1 cup pot. I like a cup of coffee in the evening - my husband doesn't. This works out well with me.\n",
      "Received Oct 25th 2019. Used twice, second time Dec 5th 2019. On that use error code HH.H displayed, would not reset. Company website said code means its broken, possible moisture damage. Never washed, inserted 1x into done chicken breast, 1x into done salmon fillet. REPLACED by new one for no cost which works fine. Quick resolution.\n",
      "Great product for the price!! I can't wait to get the color I need -- I made a mistake on this order, but can see that the product is of excellent quality!!\n",
      "Nice tray! Kitchen look nice and organize! Love it!\n",
      "I love this bed frame but it has some issues. 1st the metal slats are tiny and too much apart. No issues I thought, I will get a high quality slatted bed base on top of it. Well there is a problem as while I bought a Queen Size metal bed frame, its dimension is slightly less than the standard 60‚Äùx80‚Äù. It is 59.5‚Äù wide! No worry, I bought some plywood to fill the gap and put my high quality slat on top of it.<br /><br />I am not small size & weight and this metal frame does not move, nor tweak. Nothing! Great quality. Apartment cost is high in the NYC area so this high bed frame allows me to hide luggages and boxes under it. Just love it!<br /><br />5 star for the strength of the metal frame and its height.<br />2 star for its inadequate tiny slats.<br />Nevertheless, I give it a 4 star overall as I am very satisfied with the modification I did.\n",
      "Love that they burn clean and last for many hours! Once blown out, they relight easily. Burns almost all of the wax so there is very little waste.\n",
      "I love this scale... It is not fussy like my other scale was. I remember having to hit the TARE button over and over on my old scale, but this scale locks in right away. It is also of solid construction, well made.\n",
      "The construction of the boxes is very solid and durable. They are perfect for our needs!\n",
      "I love this vase. It looks just like the picture. I use artificial flowers in it and it works with a variety of styles.\n",
      "The replacement vacuum bags for Oreck Ironman are great. They stand up to the amount of pick-up with popping holes, fit well in the Ironman, and hold the dust pick-up great.\n",
      "My only issue is that this product, when in use, is SUPER LOUD, so much so that it literally hurts my ears. Does anyone else have this issue. And if so, how do they resolve or minimize the noise? Otherwise, this product performs greatly.\n",
      "Love having a mini serving set in my kitchen! Always need it when guest are over!\n",
      "This was super easy to put together. My youngest moves around a lot and if you child does too be prepared for all the noise.\n",
      "Good curtains\n",
      "I read many reviews complaining about Sunbeam customer service, but i have a different story. I purchased a king sized, microplush heating blanket in September, 2017. A few weeks ago, the item stopped heating. There were no warning symbols, etc, the controls lit up, but neither side would heat. I did have to place multiple calls to the help number before getting through, but when got to speak with them today, I explained the problem, they took down my basic information and said they will be sending me a replacement blanket within 5-8 days. I had an email confirming the replacement before the call ended. For a big company like that, i think that's pretty good service. Of course i am not happy about the quality and durability of the original blanket, but the interaction today with their help desk certainly changed my mind about doing business with them again. It flipped from a definite no to a definite yes. I'd say, give them a try. The will honor the warranty and without hassle. At least they did for me.\n",
      "One of the best purchases that I made on Amazon (and I buy a lot). I was a bit skeptical about buying a cheap vacuum because I was afraid it wasn‚Äôt going to work as good. But I was completely wrong! This vacuum is absolutely amazing! I use it to clean my couch, my area rug, my baby‚Äôs play area and on my hard wood floors. Basically everywhere. I use it almost 3 times a week and it does wonders. It picks up everything, dust, hair and even big particles. Its so easy to clean, its small and I love how everything comes apart, literally 3 in 1. This vacuum is perfect!\n",
      "Excellent quality, perfect fit for lumbar pillow, color matches brown/gold tone recliner.\n",
      "Nice, very clean appearance\n",
      "I ran out of room for my Shun knives and needed a bigger block. This one worked out perfectly.\n",
      "Great quality. Super cute.\n",
      "I was amazed at how well these little papers work to preserve vegetables. I was expecting to be disappointed but was pleasantly suprised. They kept green beens fresh for weeks (when they normally get slimey after a few days). These papers are liberating. I can buy a lot of vegetables at once now and not worry that they'll go bad before I can eat them.\n",
      "Love the rug! Its very soft and you can't beat that price!!<br /><br />My dog gives it an A+\n",
      "This is a terrific product, and I have ordered multiple times. However, most of them are really dirty, covered with brown dust and something on the feet. After a good wash, they are terrific.\n",
      "These are so gorgeous! They could be packaged a little better as 2 did break, but I received 14 total, so still the 12 as described not including the broken ones. They look gorgeous on display in my beach themed guest room!\n",
      "I use these in my son‚Äôs lunch for his ketchup and salad dressing. I put them in the dishwasher and they clean well. The lid is very secure. I‚Äôm quite pleased with this product!\n",
      "Sous Vide is easy with this container and lid. May take longer than baking, stewing, etc. but the entire item is cooked the same way, not over done in one spot and under done in another. You are somewhat limited to smaller cuts of meat, but could do a medium size whole chicken. Sous Vide method of cooking immerses meat or what you wish to cook that is held in a zipper bag under water that is then heated with the special heater.\n",
      "Love the paper, the fonts, the little drawings. I would just add more space for ingredients!\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "The print is perfect! The only reason I took a star away is because of the zipper. It‚Äôs positioned dead center on the bottom hem so it‚Äôs not very easy to get the pillow in compared to my other pillowcases. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great cover and I‚Äôd buy it again.\n",
      "These colorful neoprene bottle holders are really great got regular bottles of wine, they are too narrow for wider bottles. Forget squeezing a champagne bottle into one. They are so cute! I really wish they were a bit wider!\n",
      "Works great, durability has been a non-issue yet I'm still worried about it. I will buy again.\n"
